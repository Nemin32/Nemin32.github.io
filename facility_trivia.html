    <h1>Some pieces of trivia about the locations Abe visits</h1>

    <p>On this page I share some of my thought about a handful of locations we visit in
    Abe's Exoddus. Sadly the game itself doesn't really do them justice, as we only
    see the end of them and this we hardly get to know what's their purpose or
    intricacies. The quoted parts - like usually - are from "The Art of Oddworld
    Inhabitants: The First 10 Years".</p>

    <h2>Necrum Mines:</h2>
    <img class="small" src="imgs/necrummines.png">
    <p>Unusually, this place has no head-Glukkon, the only owner mentioned is the
    mysterious "SoulStorm Mining Co.". However, I believe that either this company
    is owned by the Glukkon-trio of Dripik, Aslik and Phleg or just Phleg alone.
    The former is supported in an old article where it is said that Molluck
    entrusted this trio with running the Brewery, while he was forced to hide. The
    latter is just my own thinking: Since Phleg owns Bonewerkz, the place where bone
    powder is stored, it would make the most sense that he owns the place where the
    bones are "produced" too.</p>

    <p class="bookpage">[Page 104: Untitled, about BLIND MUDOKONS]</p>
    <p class="quoted">"Adding insult to injury, blinded Mudokons are forced to dig the bones from
    their own ancestral buiral grounds. The Glukkons are so greedy that the Mudokons
    are forced to work without sight for fear that it would lower their productivity
    if they found out that they had been exploiting their own burial grounds. This
    concept was spurred from real-world historical accounts of using native people,
    whether willfully or unwittingly, to undermine and destroy the record and
    culture of their way of life. The skin of Blind Mudkons is paler than Abe's."</p>

    <h2>Necrum:</h2>
    <img class="small" src="imgs/necrum.png">
    <p>I always found it weird how when Abe escapes from the Mines he ends up
    in a jungle. After all, the introductory cutscene talks about how they have
    been travelling in a desert for the entire day and there is not a single
    tree in sight when Abe and his friends enter the burial grounds. This is
    where the Artbook comes handy as it has a paragraph detailing how the
    Necrum jungle is in fact an oasis in the middle of a desert, surrounded by
    a sacrophagus like structure. The book also notes, that since the Glukkons
    have infiltrated the place, the oasis began dying and crumbling away, which
    I suspect is intended to be a metaphor for the disappearance of old
    cultures because of greed and ignorance.</p>

    <p class="bookpage">[Page 116: NECRUM]</p>
    <p class="quoted">"Necrum is the vast burial ground for many Mudokons. It is an oasis in the
    desert sorrounded and protected by a giant stone structure reminiscent of a
    sacrophagus. It served as sacred final resting place for Mudokons long before
    Glukkons and Sligs arrived to exploit its contents. As Necrum was desecrated by
    the Glukkons and the bones of the Mudokon ancestors were stolen to create
    SoulStorm Brew, life itself was drained from the once thriving oasis. The air
    became arid and hot with the encroaching desert on its walls. All that remains
    is decayed, crumbling rock and the sparse wilted remnant of a once healthy
    junge. Early design influences were Mayan architecture and some of the
    structures from the Paris catacombs. Later rock spires, reminiscent of bone or
    worm eaten wood, were added."</p>

    <p>It is quite interesting that it seems spirits are only able to manifest in
    Necrum, as the text states, that the Weirdos are missing those limbs whose bones
    are taken out of the oasis. Also, this text confirms that Fleeches are in fact
    indigenous creatures. It is said the Vykkers genetically engineered these
    creatures to be the perfect pets for Glukkons, but for a long time I interpreted
    this as that they actually made them from scratch.</p>

    <p class="bookpage">[The Art of Oddworld Inhabitants, Page 118: NECRUM SPIRITS]</p>
    <p class="quoted">"The Three Weirdos are spirits that call upon Abe to stop the Glukkons. They are
    already missing limbs due to the removal of their bones from Necrum. They are
    covered in Mudokon ceremonial paint and headdresses. The headdresses are
    symbolic of the wildlife that lives on Oddworld. Made from natural tulle fiber
    and river ploshed gems the Paramite, Scrab and Fleech are all part of the
    ceremonial themes assigned to each of the Weirdos."</p>

    <h2>FeeCo Depot:</h2>
    <img class="small" src="imgs/feeco.png">
    <p>These are likely to be the most known information on this page, but FeeCo is
    actually a word-play on the word "fecal". Also there is a poster with the
    following text: "Uncle Aslik / Keeping the trains running on time". This is a
    reference to Mussolini, who was also referred to this way.</p>

    <img class = "small" src="imgs/aslik_trains.jpg">

    <p>It is interesting that Aslik is mentioned to be FeeCo's Vice-President here. In
    other texts, like "I, Aslik", he is referred to as SoulStorm Brewery's VP.</p>

    <p class="bookpage">[Page 123: FEECO DEPOT]</p>
    <p class="quoted">"Feeco Depot's name caused a chuckle when
      Inhabitants realized thatt it was possible to combine the word 'fee' and
      the word 'company' and create Feeco, which sounds remarkably similar to
      fecal. It was a triumphant moment in potty-humor history. Fitting that the
      vice president of Feeco Depot was named Aslik."</p>

    <p>The book also contains a paragraph on the trains Abe boards to get from one place to another.</p>

    <p class="bookpage">[Page 124: FEECO TRAIN]</p>
    <p class="quoted">"We like to think of all machines and
      architecture as a portion of the character that builds them. The first
      question we ask ourselves is who built this object and what was their
      motivation. The Glukkon mindest is that at any cost, his wealth and its
      effects are a tribute to himself. Glukkons posses a massive appetite for
      fuel and raw resources and their design reflects it. Their objects and
      environments, if at all possible are always over-built and extravagant.
      They belch fumes and smoke and show no regard for the effects on the
      environment and its Inhabitants. Given the choice, a Glukkon would always
      choose a giant all-burning beast over something more efficient. Why?
      Because they can. The train and Feeco Depot are good example of the
      production design phylosophy that this object represents a character. Its
      piercing scowl, tethered by a smoke-belching abdomen, and its centipede
      leg-powered drive rail all show attempts to add character to something
      that could have easily been a simple transportation solution."</p>

    <h2>Slig Barracks:</h2>
    <img class="small" src="imgs/sligbarracks.png">
    <p>If you think about it, Dripik's role is never really explained in the
    whole Brew-deal. Sure he has Sligs, but as the excerpt states, the location
    itself isn't used for pretty much anything. Phleg and Aslik basically
    fulfill all tasks necessary for excavating and processing bones, so our
    favorite buffon General really has no reason to be around. Through, I'm glad
    he was finally included, as this area was always my favorite in Abe's
    Exoddus, the aestethics of it were absolutely captivating and seeing those
    tents go as far as your eyes can see were a really enchanting sight for me
    when I was younger.</p>

    <p class="bookpage">[Page 135: SLIG BARRACKS]</p>
    <p class="quoted">"The Slig Barracks has never once been used in a real military conflict, but has
    been built up by the cowardly and self-important General Dripik. The Barracks
    reflect his own need for power and have been built up for years in a haphazard
    way, temprorary structure piled atop temporary structure. Everything has an over
    the top military feel-utilitarian, stripped down with no subtlety whatsoever.
    The visual "feel" for the Slig Barracks is a cross between a WW1 trench
    encampment and the Berlin Wall. Sandbags, barbed wire, sharpeend poles, Slig
    Lockers, tents, all can be found here in the barracks."</p>

    <h2>Bonewerkz:</h2>
    <img class="small" src="imgs/bonewerkz.png">
    <p>This place is the main bone-powder storage facility. When I was a child I always
    wondered, why the Glukkons feel like they're out of the stuff, if it lies in
    huge heaps at the bottom of the facility. The Artbook has an answer to this:
    Those piles are actually just useless slag. You have to wonder how much bone was
    actually processed there that just the byproduct almost fills the bottom half of
    the facility.</p>

    <p class="bookpage">[Page 129: BONEWERKZ]</p>
    <p class="quoted">"Once the Mudokon bones are harvested from Necrum, trains bring them to
    Bonewerkz, the main storage facility for bone powder used by SoulStorm Brewery.
    Brick columns support a massive hangar-like structure filled with slag heaps
    from bone powder."</p>
