* THE GDC TRAILER
(2019. 03. 20.)

On March 18 Lorne Lanning and Bennie Terry presented us with a short, five
minute showcase of one of Soulstorm's cutscenes and also a demonstration of a
model.

As expected it has generated a lot of reactions, I'd like to share mine
here. Similarly to all my other essays, this writeup is my own personal opinion,
largely based on feelings.

** THE GOOD

Most of the teaser looks quite nice. The train looks well detailed and while it
resembles the old train used in Exoddus, it became a bit more refined. It is an
example of positive deviation from the originals, along with the the new Slig
design, which I am liking a lot. While it is a bit questionable whether they could
carry gatling-guns with such little propellers, I'm willingg to suspend my
disbelief in this case. Their mouth-tentacles being smeared all over their faces
because of the wind was a nice touch for both realism and a slight touch of
humor. I am also glad that OWI kept the look of SoulStorm Brew providing at
least a small amount of connection to the old Quintology. It also being used for
fuel is an excellent idea and it makes a lot of sense considering they are
flammable.

The Shaman model was a really pleasant surprise. It radiates the old
Oddworld-feel, which made me quite happy. While I prefer the Big Face as
Oddworld's shaman figure, the garment and mask of the new figure was
astonishing. It resembles indian ceremonial clothing, but it is original enough
to not feel like a copy at all.

** THE BAD

Since the news are full of this info, it won't be a surprise to anyone, but
along with the showcase of the cutscene, the game has been delayed yet another
year. This is the third time this has happened and yet again it went down
without any kind of fanfare.

As for the video itself, it sadly continues the trend of being overly
cinematic. For example, the "camera" became an actualy camera instead of some
ethereal, non-existent thing through which we see the events. What I mean by
this is that through the entire clip the picture has dust specks on it. I firmly
believe that this is a bad direction to take the game's art direction
towards. Oddworld never needed to be like a movie to provide the same amount of
entertainment movies do. To add insult to injury, these dust specks are totally
static. If they dinamically flew on and flew off the camera, it'd feel much less
fake.

While my untrained eyes didn't spot anything else, I'd like to link Phoetux's
comment on OWF about the video, where he goes way more in-depth about the
possible flaws of the animation.

** THE UGLY

The Mudokons.

Alf is bearable, albeit some of his facial expressions look quite unnatural (and
not in the Oddworldish sense). My only concern with him is that at the end of
the video when he walks through the inside of the train, his animations feel
way too weightless and floaty.

But Toby... He is different. There are truly very few characters in Oddworld and
almost all of them are part of Stranger's Wrath, but after this video this group
has sadly grew with one more member.

Not only is he terribly awkward in a bad way, his animation and facial
expressions defy logic. People have brought up that Oddworld used goofy
characters and animations before and it's true, however, they were always much
more moderate even when they were played for laughs.

Compare the over the top nature of the gif above with the blind Mudokon Abe
unwittingly killed in Exoddus. It was a joke, yet it was also quite dark and it
also provided info for the player (Blind Mudokons will fall into their
death).

** THE MEH

Alf saying "Holy shit!" did raise my eyebrow, but ultimately I don't
really have strong feelings about Oddworld characters using stronger
swears.

Toby gets his hand shot. This belongs in this category as unless you
watch the video on 0.25x speed, it is pretty much unnoticeable.

Abe not being in the video. I'll explain shortly below why I think
he's not here.

** Conclusion and Theory

So the watchful viewer can notice quite a few things that help us
roughly place this cutscene in the timeline of the game. In my
reading, this is at least a mid-game cutscene, but even more likely
it's a late-game one. My reasoning is the following:

- Toby and Alf are riding towards SoulStorm Brewery, the central
  location of the entire story.
- The aforementioned characters being 'comfortable' in each others'
  presence. If this was an early-game cutscene, they'd be less
  "casual" talking with eachother.
- Alf has surpassed his Brew addiction and is throwing the drink
  without second thoughts into the fire.
- Abe is nowhere to be seen. I believe he's most likely captive in
  SoulStorm Brewery and that's why the duo is riding the train there.

Ultimately despite my bashing of the video, it was still a postiive
experience, just not the kind I believe Oddworld Inhabitants is
capable of.
