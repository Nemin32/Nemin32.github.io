ARG:

SPIRIT OF 1029 - A Mudokon group of revolutionaries, created and named after
Abe's deeds in RuptureFarms 1029. They like to liken themselves to a storm.
Their main way of communication are short Tweets denouncing the Magog Cartel and
short catchphrases like "We will rise!". Also their logo is based on the
front-side view of RuptureFarms erupting in flames.

THE MAGOG CARTEL - Diabolical as always, they both tell you that everything
is fine and also that if anything is not fine, it's not their fault. They like
to alternate between propaganda fliers and sardonic remarks towards employees,
products and workplace-safety. Their logo is similar to the old octopus-like
black and white emblem, however, it has become sleeker and taller.

ED - This scaredy schmuck is actually a really important part of the resistance.
By leaking information he brings the horrors the Magog to the public's
attention. He personally never says too much and that little is usually filled
with him being afraid.

ALF - This Mud is not someone you need to be introduced to. He's smooth as
always, however, the recent turn of events and Ed's pleas have revealed this
usually cheerful guy's caring and anxious side.

ASSET98 - Another member of the SO1029. While his input provided to be very
important in solving the mysteries of the ARG, his career was cut short when the
Cartel caught and executed him because of the community's mishap.

ASSET99 - Asset 98's successor, he is just as secretive as 98 was. He also
provided vital information towards the solutions of multiple puzzles.
