INFORMATION ABOUT THE GAME:
Most of the gameplay information in the EGX talk collected into an easily
digestible list.

- The game will still be a platformer, albeit it's levels will be "much more
  exciting than in the previous games".

  Lorne Lanning: "Abe is really about followers, empathy, puzzles. So how do we
  do that but really turn the volume up to eleven on the genre? So I call it a
  platformer game and then push that dynamic too."

  Alex Carroll: "I can say our levels are way more interesting."

- The game will feature a crafting system.

  Lorne Lanning: "And those consumer products, he can start converting into
  weapons and he can have then start finding with collectibles crafting those
  weapons into more specialized things. So inventory system and crafting has
  become a key part of what Abe does to get all these Mudokons through the world
  safely, hopefully."

- The new thematic around brew is that if a Mudokon becomes addicted to it, then
  two days of withdrawal will result in their death by cardiac arrest. [[VIDEO
  (check top left corner)]](https://youtu.be/L3zdCg4tbOc?t=16m55s)

- The brew is also very flammable, which can be potentially used in gameplay
  (area control?).

  Lorne Lanning: "So let's just say brew, one of the side effects of brew is
  that it's highly flammable. And everyone's addicted to it!"

- Abe will be able to lead a huge number of Mudokons (up to 301) and OWI
  completely overhauled the GameSpeak to make this comfortable to use.

  Lorne Lanning: "So this game begins with 301 freed Mudokons, that you're going
  to try and take with you through the journey, because they don't just
  disappear into the ether, they're gonna stay with you and at times in real
  time, in play you'll be managing the survival of this many guys on screen at
  one time."

  Alex Carroll: "We wouldn’t make it hard. If there are that many on screen at
  once (and in some cases there are) then Abe’s control over them is slightly
  different. We’ve refined Abe’s Gamespeak considerably."

- It seems like the Mudokons will be capable of fighting back and the player can
  select how aggressive they will act.

- Abe will have an HP bar, Ammo counter and he can also collect Moolah. And he
  will also be able to amass Chi, which will let him use powerful abilities.

- To get the best ending no Slig must die. (Whether we can save them or we just
  have to leave them be is not known.)

  Lorne Lanning: "And in this game you trying not to ideally kill the Sligs
  either. So a perfect play nobody dies.  That's hard as hell! You know, there's
  a lot of PTSD trauma that's going to take place before you achieve that goal,
  but that's our goal. In the ideal world Abe would have been able to traverse
  this very different, dangerous landscape and do that without killing anybody
  not even Sligs."

- There is now a concrete Pyramid of Power that shows us just how powerful
  certain positions are. [[PIC]](https://i.imgur.com/we4MsdU.png)

- RuptureFarms is confirmed to have burned down after it has been struck by
  lightning from the Mudokon Rainmaker.

- The original trio of Glukkons is now gone, replaced by brand ones.
  However, Molluck has returned and he looks pretty pissed off. Interestingly
  there is no Dripik. As I've discussed before [Location Trivia], he didn't have
  much role in the Exoddus, so perhaps he is not part of Soulstorm's story.

  Lorne Lanning: "We've renamed all the Glukkons that come with the other
  factories, so Aslik, Dripik and all of this. These are different guys now, as
  we were getting more away from what that original story was."

- The theme of Occultism seems to be returning in SS as evidenced by one Glukkon
  wearing the "Royal Society **Alchemic** Science" badge.

ITEMS:
In the EGX talk Lanning showcased a few of the items found in Soulstorm. Here's
a list of these screenshot out of the video. OWI has said that these items are
early iterations of what we will be able to find in the final version, so take
everything here with a grain of salt. The text in quotes are the official
descriptions shown in the gameplay footage, the rest are my thoughts.

Brew Bottle - "Splashy, sticky, very tasty and highly flammable. Soulstorm Brew
will help you get the party started and then help you burn down the venue when
you've had enough."

Bottle Cap - "We can't believe this ever got past the Food Standards people, but
they put bottlecaps on Soulstorm Brew that make sparks when they hit against
hard materials. Sparks plus flammable liquid equals fun."

Fire Extinguisher - "Look, we've all done it. Sometimes you just set fire to
something you wanted to keep. Use this handy fire extinguisher to hastily
correct your overzealous use of flames."

Empty Bottle - "An empty bottle? What was inside? Who's been having a party?
Why weren't you invited? Never mind, at least these things can be recycled,
right?"

Gum - "The flavor lasts for a few a seconds, but the stickiness is eternal.
Chew this up a bit and you can use it to stick one thing to another thing.
Handy!"

Lighter - "It's like carrying a flint, some kindling at all times. Use it to
start fires where there were previously no fires. Also handy to stick to other
objects that might benefit from a quick and convenient fire source."

Flamethrower - "Well done. You've taken something that was made solely for
putting out fires, tinkered around with it and made it into something that makes
fire at a prodigious rate. Your momma would be proud."

Recipe: Fire extinguisher + Soulstorm Brew + Lighter

Purple bottle with a green decal and "PoP" written on it in white - Reminds me a
bit of the drinks you could get in Munch's Oddysee. Perhaps OWI is revisiting
this concept.

Purple bottle with a green decal and a purple band over it - The color of this
band is very similar to the gum, so perhaps this is the result of crafting the
two together.

Jawbreaker-esque round object - I have seriously no idea what this could be. It
looks similar to a ball, but I don't have any idea why would you be able to
carry around one. You can spot a few shapes on it, like a star in the
bottom-left corner. Also, as the picture shows, you can carry 20 of these, so
this object being big would make no sense.

Blue drink in an SSB bottle - This is obviously the bottle of SoulStorm Brew,
however, the contents aren't the usual green, but instead a shade of blue. My
only speculation is that it is perhaps medicine you can give your addicted
Mudokons, so they don't die for another 48 hours, but without the side-effects
or the flammability of the Brew.

CHARACTERS OF THE ARG:

SPIRIT OF 1029 - A Mudokon group of revolutionaries, created and named after
Abe's deeds in RuptureFarms 1029. They like to liken themselves to a storm.
Their main way of communication are short Tweets denouncing the Magog Cartel and
short catchphrases like "We will rise!". Also their logo is based on the
front-side view of RuptureFarms erupting in flames.

THE MAGOG CARTEL - Diabolical as always, they both tell you that everything is
fine and also that if anything is not fine, it's not their fault. They like to
alternate between propaganda fliers and sardonic remarks towards employees,
products and workplace-safety. Their logo is similar to the old octopus-like
black and white emblem, however, it has become sleeker and taller.

ED - This scaredy schmuck is actually a really important part of the resistance.
By leaking information he brings the horrors the Magog to the public's
attention. He personally never says too much and that little is usually filled
with him being afraid.

ALF - This Mud is not someone you need to be introduced to. He's smooth as
always, however, the recent turn of events and Ed's pleas have revealed this
usually cheerful guy's caring and anxious side.

ASSET98 - Another member of the SO1029. While his input provided to be very
important in solving the mysteries of the ARG, his career was cut short when the
Cartel caught and executed him because of the community's mishap.

ASSET99 - Asset 98's successor, he is just as secretive as 98 was. He also
provided vital information towards the solutions of multiple puzzles.
