INFORMATION ABOUT THE GAME:

ITEMS:

In the EGX talk Lanning showcased a few of the items found in Soulstorm. Here's
a list of these screenshot out of the video. OWI has said that these items are
early iterations of what we will be able to find in the final version, so take
everything here with a grain of salt.

Brew Bottle - "Splashy, sticky, very tasty and highly flammable. Soulstorm Brew
will help you get the party started and then help you burn down the venue when
you've had enough."

Bottle Cap - "We can't believe this ever got past the Food Standards people,
but they put bottlecaps on Soulstorm Brew that make sparks when they hit against
hard materials. Sparks plus flammable liquid equals fun."

Fire Extinguisher - "Look, we've all done it. Sometimes you just set fire to
something you wanted to keep. Use this handy fire extinguisher to hastily
correct your overzealous use of flames."

Empty Bottle - "An empty bottle? What was inside? Who's been having a party?
Why weren't you invited? Never mind, at least these things can be recycled,
right?"

Gum - "The flavor lasts for a few a seconds, but the stickiness is eternal.
Chew this up a bit and you can use it to stick one thing to another thing.
Handy!"

Lighter - "It's like carrying a flint, some kindling at all times. Use it to
start fires where there were previously no fires. Also handy to stick to other
objects that might benefit from a quick and convenient fire source."

Flame thrower - "Well done. You've taken something that was made solely for
putting out fires, tinkered around with it and made it into something that makes
fire at a prodigious rate. Your momma would be proud."

Recipe: Fire extinguisher + Soulstorm Brew + Lighter

Purple bottle with a green decal and "PoP" written on it in white

Purple bottle with a green decal and a purple band over it - The color of this
band is very similar to the gum, so perhaps this is the result of crafting the
two together.

Jawbreaker-esque round object - I have seriously no idea what this could be. It
looks similar to a ball, but I don't have any idea why would you be able to
carry around one. You can spot a few shapes on it, like a star in the
bottom-left corner. Also, as the picture shows, you can carry 20 of these, so
this object being big would make no sense.

Blue drink in an SSB bottle - This is obviously the bottle of SoulStorm Brew,
however, the contents aren't the usual green, but instead a shade of blue. My
only speculation is that it is perhaps medicine you can give your addicted
Mudokons, so they don't die for another 48 hours, but without the side-effects
or the flammability of the Brew.

CHARACTERS OF THE ARG:

SPIRIT OF 1029 - A Mudokon group of revolutionaries, created and named after
Abe's deeds in RuptureFarms 1029. They like to liken themselves to a storm.
Their main way of communication are short Tweets denouncing the Magog Cartel and
short catchphrases like "We will rise!". Also their logo is based on the
front-side view of RuptureFarms erupting in flames.

THE MAGOG CARTEL - Diabolical as always, they both tell you that everything
is fine and also that if anything is not fine, it's not their fault. They like
to alternate between propaganda fliers and sardonic remarks towards employees,
products and workplace-safety. Their logo is similar to the old octopus-like
black and white emblem, however, it has become sleeker and taller.

ED - This scaredy schmuck is actually a really important part of the resistance.
By leaking information he brings the horrors the Magog to the public's
attention. He personally never says too much and that little is usually filled
with him being afraid.

ALF - This Mud is not someone you need to be introduced to. He's smooth as
always, however, the recent turn of events and Ed's pleas have revealed this
usually cheerful guy's caring and anxious side.

ASSET98 - Another member of the SO1029. While his input provided to be very
important in solving the mysteries of the ARG, his career was cut short when the
Cartel caught and executed him because of the community's mishap.

ASSET99 - Asset 98's successor, he is just as secretive as 98 was. He also
provided vital information towards the solutions of multiple puzzles.
