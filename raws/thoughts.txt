If you think about it, the attire of the Glukkons is extremely ironic. Their
anatomy would basically let them either run quickly or swing from place to the
other like a monkey. Yet instead of embracing this side of themselves, they hide
their bodies out of pride and meaningless societal customs in tight suits, that
basically bind their hands together, giving them their signature wobbly walk.

KHANZUMERS - UNSTOPPABLE FORCE OR GULLIBLE FOOLS?

There is a kind of dissonance in the Oddworld Canon about the real power the
consumers - or as they are called in Oddworld Khanzumers - have. Many of
Lanning's interviews place them into an almost god-like status, as creatures,
who have to be appeased or else they would destroy whichever franchise ruined
their mood. However, the interview linked above paints a much different picture.
Here they are vastly different as these Khanzumers depict the gullible and
conformist stereotype of the real-world buyers, who are used as an excuse by
companies who do horrible things in the name of giving them all they want.
