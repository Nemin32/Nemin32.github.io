If you think about it, the attire of the Glukkons is extremely ironic. Their
anatomy would basically let them either run quickly or swing from place to the
other like a monkey. Yet instead of embracing this side of themselves, they hide
their bodies out of pride and meaningless societal customs in tight suits, that
basically bind their hands together, giving them their signature wobbly walk.
