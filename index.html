  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>
    Oddwords is a quasi-journalistic site founded in 2018, created to document
    and discuss the various games and events related to the Oddworld series, its
    community, and its developers.
  </p>

  <p>
    While most of the content on the site deals with Soulstorm, especially its
    pre-release material, you can also find game critiques, interviews, articles
    about various more or less known aspects of the series, a few surveys
    conducted by me, and even a couple of fanfics.
  </p>

  <p>I hope you enjoy your stay!</p>
