# My review of *Oddworld: Abe's Origins*

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/origins/aonew.webp" description="The final cover of Abe's Origins, featuring very few colors and visual elements." %}

Back in 2018 a new artbook was announced using first the ARG and later social
media by OWI. The book was created by a company called [Indie by
Design](https://indiebydesign.net) which is run by two people and have been
making similar books since 2015.

I originally wasn't going to get this book, mostly because of financial reasons,
however, with the help of a really generous fan and friend (thanks again Dark!)
I was ultimately able to have a copy of my own.

I have read through the book since and have plenty to say about it, so I figured
the best way to share it would be through an article here. Let's begin.

## Appearance

The book looks good! It's way thicker than what I expected, it is truly like a
tome. The paper quality is excellent and very strong, on the materials-front
Abe's Origins wins by an arms length compared to The Art of Oddworld
Inhabitants: The First Ten Years (which I'll be referring to as TFTY from now on).

On the other hand, the choice of cover is weird to say the very least. This is -
similarly to the rest of the review - absolutely subjective, but I found the new
cover a bit bland, compared to TFTY's imposing and remarkable image, depicting
the old twin-fetus logo of OWI.

Farzad Varahramyan's slightly smiling Abe is a fitting representation of the
character. As an artwork there is of course no problem with it. However, as a
cover I think it fails do fulfill its purpose of capturing the potential reader
and not letting them go until they buy the book and find out their secrets. The
old book with its almost morbid appearance was much more captivating in my
opinion.

## Lorne Lanning Interview

The book starts with a huge interview, where Indie By Design asks several dozen
questions from OWI's co-founder. I personally wouldn't really linger on it,
because it's mostly old content, sometimes the answer Mr. Lanning gives as
almost word-by-word what he said previously.

> **Lorne Lanning:** For me, being a relatively poor kid growing up with
> parents who were divorced and having a single mum, I was thinking of art as a
> way to make a living. **I was drawing axes and dragons** and a lot of the
> stuff that young kids are really compelled by, but I wasn’t thinking about it
> deeply.

All in all, if you're not exactly stoked about the idea of reading decades old
interviews and just want a distilled version, the interview can be worthwhile to
read, but otherwise you won't find much as much new content here as one would
expect.

## The Pictures


{% include caption.html url="/imgs/origins/aoimg.webp" description="A look at the images in Abe's Origins. Image from: <a href ='https://indie-by-design.myshopify.com/products/oddworld-abes-origins'>Indie By Design</a>." %}

The image quality leaves little to be desired. The pictures are crisp and the
artists' notes can easily be read, which is a huge plus as they provide a little
insight into their own personality and the company culture of late-nineties OWI.
The old masters of art who used to work at OWI truly did their best to create a
world so alien, yet alive at the same time. Their work can only be praised. It
is quite touching and humanizing to see the little notes they left next to their
concept arts. Little jokes, insightful comments and a lot of exclamation marks
show that these people weren't only working with care, they were putting their
heart and soul into it. Don't get me wrong, TFTY didn't dehumanize them at all,
but the focus was less on this part of their work.

However, the selection of the images is a bit disappointing. Whether the
supposedly nearly endless supply of concept art isn't all that endless after all
or OWI was just unwilling to crack open a previously unseen vault of images,
most of the content in the book was already presented to us in one way or
another (as part of TFTY, [The Lost Archives](/foundarchives),
[TOGG](http://oddworldlibrary.net/archives/togg/) or elsewhere). This of course
doesn't mean that there isn't a single new image in the book, there are some,
it's just that one would expect what TFTY delivered: A huge cache of exclusive
content.

## The Descriptions

This is where I feel like the book falls apart a little. I do not know the
reasons why, but the descriptions given for the images are some of the
blandest, most minimally functional texts I've read in any book yet. I really
don't wish to offend IBD (I assume they wrote these), but it was hard not to
roll my eyes as I read paragraph after paragraph of almost the same content.
It's like the same basic information was phrased five or six times to fill out
the pages.

The book repeatedly goes out of its way to say how greedy the Glukkons and how
unethical the Vykkers are. This is something anyone who ever played an Oddworld
game knows and even if they didn't, mentioning it once should be enough.

At places the book even leaves out things previously established. While this
wouldn't otherwise be a problem, the book otherwise is acting like a definite
source of background lore, so I think this is detrimental. Take for example the
description of Skillya, the Slig queen:

> **Abe's Origins, Page 236:**
>
> Skillya, queen of the Sligs, is one of Oddworld's largest, laziest
> inhabitants. Her every need is catered for by the Glukkons in return for her
> giving birth to a stream of fresh Sligs that are immediately taken away to
> begin their training as guard and soldiers for the Magog Cartel.
>
> She is a fickle, easily-pleased individual and a mother who seemingly gives no
> thought to the fact that her offspring are destined for a life of servitude
> and submission under direct Glukkon rule. Much like the brood she births, as
> long as Skillya's needs are met she is a willing servant to her corporate
> masters.

In contrast, this is what OWI's official [Queens](https://oddworld.com/queens)
page says (and it's not even the whole article):

> **Selfish Motivations**
>
> Skillya sells the Sligs as security workers and directly benefits from it. The
> explanation for her behaviour is simple - she hates her children.
>
> The birthing process is so painful for her that it fills her with a deep
> hatred towards those she considers responsible. Her anger surfaces in other,
> even more unusual ways, too - it isn’t uncommon for her to eat her children as
> soon as they’re born, just as pay back for the suffering they cause her during
> delivery.
>
> **Nature or Nurture?**
> 
> Maybe the Sligs inherit their Mother’s mean streak, or perhaps this goes some
> way to explaining their sadistic behaviour. On top of never having known any
> love or affection, the Sligs also have to deal with the fact that if they
> don’t scramble away fast enough when they’re born their Mother might just eat
> them alive.

The differences here are evident. While the Queens page itself simplified on the
characters, the book reduces their depth even more. Perhaps the reason behind
this was that other things took up the space, but I'm not entirely convinced.

One of the strongest parts of TFTY was that it contained lore never heard
before. It was comparable to "Nathan interviews Lorne Lanning" and its sequel,
which are both interviews that expand the world of Oddworld immensely.
Meanwhile, had there not been so many notes left by the artists, I would have
been left knowing nothing more than I did before reading the book. I'm not
saying this to boast about my knowledge, rather to point out that most fans know
what's written here very well already.

## Soulstorm Info

I imagine this is what a lot of people are interested in. There isn't much. We
get to see the same promotional matte paintings of the new/reworked locations
that OWI has been showing us since 2017 and the Glukkons' names are
revealed. Despite what Lorne Lanning said in 2017, most of them are using their
old names.

> **Lorne Lanning, 2017, [EGX](/egx):** We’ve renamed all the Glukkons that
> come with the other factories, so Aslik, Dripik and all of this. These are
> different guys now, as we were getting more away from what that original
> story was. This is focusing on the later story.

Molluck is still Molluck. The Brewmaster is still the Brewmaster. Aslik is still
Aslik. However, the mean looking Glukkons who kind of looks like a hammearhead
shark was named Baron. I found this name a bit weird. It's much too "normal"
next to the others, but this is of course just a nitpick.

## All-in-all

So... Is Abe's Origins a bad book? No, "bad" is definitely not the word I'd
use.  It does not commit any huge crimes and I am sure Indie By Design tried
their best. However, "superfluous" is a word I probably would use. If you never
read TFTY, you might enjoy Abe's Origins a lot. But if you did, it's doubtful
whether you'll find your money's worth here.

Of course this is something everyone will decide for themselves, but I
personally recommend sticking with sites like
[MoM](https://magogonthemarch.wordpress.com) and TFTY, which while isn't sold
anymore officially, can easily be found online at second-hand sellers.
