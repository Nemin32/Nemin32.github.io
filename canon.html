      <h1>So you want to learn about Oddworld?</h1>

      <p>Welcome! Whether you are new to the series or a returning fan,
	this page intends to help you find more information about Oddworld
	released and unreleased canon.</p>

    <main>
      <h2>Sites</h2>
      <p>These sites contain content related to Oddworld.  Because each
	handles a different kinds of materials, using all of them is
	recommended:</p>

      <div class="ul_container">
	<ul class="small">
	  <li><a href="https://oddworldlibrary.net">TOL</a> :: Xavier's Wiki of
	    Oddworld. It's a well-monitored source of lore that only a
	    select few members can edit. Because of this, the site is
	    relatively small, but should not be underestimated. Also this
	    domain contains other projects like
	    <a href="http://oddworldlibrary.net/archives/togg/">TOGG</a> and
	    <a href="https://oddworldlibrary.net/archives/web/">OWWW</a> which are
	    the largest resources of Oddworld images and archived Oddworld
	    websites respectively.</li>

	  <li><a href="https://oddworld.fandom.com">The Wikia</a> :: The public
	    Oddworld Wiki. It had a long history of being plagued by
	    misinformation and fanon presented as canon, however, in the
	    recent years it has been taken over by a competent staff that
	    almost completely renovated the site, making it a useful and
	    valid resource.</li>

	  <li><a href="https://magogonthemarch.com">Magog on the March</a> :: Unlike
	    the previous two wikies this site is less concerned with
	    documenting things, but rather it's real strength is archiving
	    all kinds of obscure information that I have no idea how they
	    can even find. The site's design might be a tad bit confusing
	    at first, but believe me, if something ever mentioned
	    Oddworld, you can almost be sure that M.o.M. has or will have
	    it archived. Also time by time they release videos and essays
	    about Oddworld's lore in a very beginner-friendly format.</li>

	  <li><a href="https://oddworldforums.net">OWF</a> :: While the forum has
	    since fallen from grace a bit, the thread archivescontain
	    valuable information from several (ex-)OWI members. Admittedly
	    OWF is probably the hardest place to find info on, but it is
	    there and with some spelunking one might just hit gold.</li>

	  <li><a href="https://oddwords.hu">Oddwords</a> :: My goal is to both
	    theorize and make the lore a bit more easily understandable to
	    the common fan.</li>
	</ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Recommended reading material</h2>
      <p>This is obviously a subjective list, however, I believe every
	fan who considers themselves interested in the bigger picture
	should read at least some of these as they touch upon a few of the
	most important aspects of planet Oddworld:</p>

      <div class="ul_container">
	<ul class="small">
	  <li><a href="https://magogonthemarch.com/nathan-interviews-lorne-lanning-again/">Nathan interviews Lorne Lanning again</a> :: My personal favorite and
	    pretty much the most important interview of them all. We get
	    answers to things like the planets size and structure, a
	    glimpse into the Industrialist world, how Mudokons worked
	    before they were enslaved, etc.</li>

	  <li><a href="https://magogonthemarch.com/2008-2/nathan-interviews-lorne-lanning/">Nathan interviews Lorne Lanning</a> :: The previous part of the
	    interview above has almost as many important details. Together
	    they give you a good grasp about the situation going on.</li>

	  <li><a href="https://magogonthemarch.com/oddworld-history/">Oddworld History</a> :: The first events that sparked the conflict
	    between Glukkons and Mudokons told in a kind of campfire
	    story-like manner.</li>

	  <li><a href="https://magogonthemarch.com/abes-exoddus-inhabitants/">Abe's Exoddus - Inhabitants</a> :: While the page concerns itself
	    mostly with the characters appearing in Exoddus, it provides
	    enough info about them to earn a place on this list.</li>

	  <li><a href="https://magogonthemarch.com/transcripts/egx-2017-lorne-lanning-interview/">EGX 2017 Caddicarus interview</a> :: In this interview Lorne Lanning
	    answered questions about the upcoming game, Soulstorm, Mudokon
	    anatomy, the old Quintology and other Oddworld-related topics.</li>

	  <li><a href="https://oddworldlibrary.net/wiki/Soulstorm_ARG_Summary">Soulstorm ARG Summary</a> :: This one is a bit of an odd one out, because
	    the content here was organized by Xavier and myself. It
	    contains the story of the Soulstorm ARG in a condensed, but
	    still detailed way.</li>

	  <li>Developer diaries:<br>
	    * <a href="https://oddworldlibrary.net/wiki/Abe%27s_Exoddus_Designer_Diaries_on_Videogames.com">Abe's Exoddus - Videogames.net</a><br>
	    * <a href="https://oddworldlibrary.net/wiki/Munch%27s_Oddysee_Designer_Diaries_on_Videogames.com">Munch's Oddysee - Videogames.net</a><br>
	    * <a href="https://oddworldlibrary.net/wiki/Munch%27s_Oddysee_Designer_Diaries_on_PlayNOW!/">Munch's Oddysee - PlayNOW!</a></li>

	  <li><a href="https://magogonthemarch.com/qa/reddit-ama-2012/">Reddit AMA 2012</a> :: A free-form Q&A where Stewart Gilray and Lorne
	    Lanning answered some of the fans' questions, about their
	    personal life, the games, what their future projects were and
	    other topics.

	  <li>The Art of Oddworld Inhabitants: The First Ten Years :: This book
	    is a treasure trove, sadly quite literally. Because it was
	    printed in such limited numbers, finding a reasonably priced
	    copy isn't exactly easy, especially if you prefer hardcover
	    books. Sadly for some reason the book was never reprinted, nor
	    released as an e-book.

	    <br><br>

	    However, a certain Russian fellow going by the name слиг
	    (that's "slig" written using the Cyrillic-alphabet) scanned in
	    the book and published it on a few sites. While I can't share
	    the links here for obvious reasons, I suggest looking around
	    on the Internet Archive.</li>
	</ul>

      <h2>Where to talk with others about the canon?</h2>
      <p>Of course none of this mean much if you don't have anyone else
	to talk about the story. Here are a few communities where you can
	talk about the canon or anything else Oddworld related:</p>

      <div class="ul_container">
	<ul class="small">
	  <li><a href="https://discord.gg/oddworld">Official Oddworld</a> :: OWI's own
	    Discord. Currently this community has the largest active
	    fanbase and you can even chat with the developers here.</li>

	  <li><a href="http://discord.gg/JGeyUMn">OWF's Discord</a> :: The second
	    largest Discord, started by a few OWF community members. The
	    server has less rules and is because of this a lot more
	    laid-back.</li>

	  <li><a href="https://reddit.com/r/Oddworld">The Oddworld Reddit</a> :: A
	    relatively small Reddit community based around the game. While
	    it isn't particularly active, it does have a very loyal core
	    that comment under basically any kind of post.</li>

	  <li><a href="http://oddworldforums.net">OWF</a> :: Of course OWF is not only
	    a lore source, but also a place where you can talk about the
	    games. While the population of the site dropped considerably
	    throughout the years, but it's still a very important
	    community for discussing Oddworld.</li>
