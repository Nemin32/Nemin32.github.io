      <h1>So you want to learn about Oddworld?</h1>

      <p>Welcome! Whether you are new to the series or a returning fan,
	this page intends to help you find more information about Oddworld
	released and unreleased canon.</p>

    <main>
      <h2>Sites</h2>
      <p>These sites contain content related to Oddworld.  Because each
	handles a different kinds of materials, using all of them is
	recommended:</p>

      <div class="ul_container">
	<ul class="small">
	  <li><a href="https://oddworldlibrary.net">TOL</a> :: Xavier's Wiki of
	    Oddworld. It's a well-monitored source of lore that only a
	    select few members can edit. Because of this, the site is
	    relatively small, but should not be underestimated. Also this
	    domain contains other projects like
	    <a href="http://oddworldlibrary.net/archives/togg/">TOGG</a> and
	    <a href="https://oddworldlibrary.net/archives/web/">OWWW</a> which are
	    the largest resources of Oddworld images and archived Oddworld
	    websites respectively.</li>

	  <li><a href="https://oddworld.fandom.com">The Wikia</a> :: The public
	    Oddworld Wiki. It had a long history of being plagued by
	    misinformation and fanon presented as canon, however, in the
	    recent years it has been taken over by a competent staff that
	    almost completely renovated the site, making it a useful and
	    valid resource.</li>

	  <li><a href="https://magogonthemarch.com">Magog on the March</a> ::
	    Unlike the previous two wikis this site is less concerned with
	    documenting things, but rather it's real strength is archiving all
	    kinds of obscure information that I have no idea how they can even
	    find. The site's design might be a tad bit confusing at first, but
	    believe me, if something ever mentioned Oddworld, you can almost be
	    sure that M.o.M. has or will have it archived. Also time by time
	    they
	    release <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8rCjlKx9PjbhBN0_UcEXDg/featured">videos</a>
	    about Oddworld's lore in a very beginner-friendly format.</li>

	  <li><a href="https://oddworldforums.net">OWF</a> :: While the forum has
	    since fallen from grace a bit, the thread archives contain
	    valuable information from several (ex-)developers. Admittedly
	    OWF is probably the hardest place to find info on, but it is
	    there and with some spelunking one might just hit gold.</li>

	  <li><a href="https://oddwords.hu">Oddwords</a> :: My goal is to both
	    theorize and make the lore a bit more easily understandable to
	    the common fan.</li>
	</ul>
      </div>

      <img src="imgs/canon/oldslig.jpg">

      <h2>Recommended reading material</h2>
      <p>This is obviously a subjective list, however, I believe every
	fan who considers themselves interested in the bigger picture
	should read at least some of these as they touch upon a few of the
	most important aspects of planet Oddworld:</p>

      <div class="ul_container">
	<ul class="small">
	  <li><a href="https://magogonthemarch.com/nathan-interviews-lorne-lanning-again/">Nathan
	    interviews Lorne Lanning again</a> :: My personal favorite and
	    pretty much the most important interview of them all. We get answers
	    to things like the planets size and structure, a glimpse into the
	    Industrialist world, how Mudokons worked before they were enslaved,
	    etc.</li>

	  <li><a href="https://magogonthemarch.com/2008-2/nathan-interviews-lorne-lanning/">Nathan
	    interviews Lorne Lanning</a> :: The previous part of the interview
	    above has almost as many important details. Together they give a
	    good grasp about the situation going on.</li>

	  <li><a href="https://magogonthemarch.com/oddworld-history/">Oddworld
	    History</a> :: The first events that sparked the conflict between
	    Glukkons and Mudokons told in a kind of campfire story-like
	    manner.</li>

	  <li><a href="https://magogonthemarch.com/abes-exoddus-inhabitants/">Abe's
	    Exoddus - Inhabitants</a> :: While the page concerns itself mostly
	    with the characters appearing in Exoddus, it provides enough info
	    about them to earn a place on this list.</li>

	  <li><a href="https://magogonthemarch.com/transcripts/egx-2017-lorne-lanning-interview/">EGX
	    2017 Caddicarus interview</a> :: In this interview Lorne Lanning
	    answered questions about the upcoming game, Soulstorm, Mudokon
	    anatomy, the old Quintology and other Oddworld-related topics.</li>

	  <li><a href="https://oddworldlibrary.net/wiki/Soulstorm_ARG_Summary">Soulstorm
	    ARG Summary</a> :: This wiki page contains the summary of the plot
	    of Soulstorm's ARG condensed into one long post by Xavier and
	    myself.</li>

	  <li>Developer diaries:<br>

	  <li><a href="https://magogonthemarch.com/qa/reddit-ama-2012/">Reddit
	    AMA 2012</a> :: A free-form Q&A where Stewart Gilray and Lorne
	    Lanning answered some of the fans' questions, about their personal
	    life, the games, what their future projects were and other topics.</li>

	  <li>The Art of Oddworld Inhabitants: The First Ten Years :: This book
	    is a treasure trove, sadly quite literally. Because it was printed
	    in such limited numbers, finding a reasonably priced copy isn't
	    exactly easy, especially if you prefer hardcover books. Sadly for
	    some reason the book was never reprinted, nor released as an e-book.</li>
	</ul>

      <h2>How to start researching a topic?</h2>
      <p><i>"Why do Sligs wear masks? Why's Abe's mouth stitched?  How
	  come we never hear about a Vykker queen?"</i></p>

      <p>Eventually all fans start asking themselves questions like this, but
	finding the answers might not be as straightforward as one would
	think. I'd like to share here my method, which I'm by no means claiming
	to be the best, but it has worked for me, so it might inspire a few
	readers.</p>

      <p>The first step is to check whether TOL has an article about the
	question you're interested in. It usually answer the easier answers in
	itself. </p>

      <p>However, if TOL doesn't provide a satisfactory answer don't give up
	hope yet, because MoM will surely have at least some obscure reference
	to the topic you're looking for. Enter your topic in the searchbar. Try
	using as few words as possible, because the query only shows exact
	matches. Short expressions like 'Slig' or 'Molluck', etc. are
	preferrable. This will likely return a whole lot of articles. I suggest
	first reading through a few relevant Dear Alfs. Lorne Lanning took the
	time and effort to make Alf vague, but every once in a blue, Mudokon-paw
	bearing moon his tounge "slips" and we get some
	deep insight into Oddworld.</p>

      <p>After Alf, you should continue with developer interviews. There is a
	surprising amount of information hidden in these, that we only know about
	because Lorne Lanning or someone else casually dropped it.</p>

      <p>Hopefully by now you have found whatever you're looking for, but if
	not, it might be worth it to check MoM's video archives which contain
	almost every appearance of OWI and other developers working on Oddworld
	caught on tape.</p>

      <p>(You might be surprised why I'm not mentioning the other wiki
	here. While I do think it's a great resource, I don't recommend newbies
	to use it as a way of building their knowledge, as nearly all pages
	aren't or are only scarcely cited, making it hard to decide what's real
	and what's not, as some misinformation has slipped between the new
	staff's fingers.)</p>

      <p>((If you actually want answers to those questions above, here's the gist of
	it:</p>

      <div class="ul_container">
	<ul class="small">
	  <li>Glukkons found Sligs far too repulsive, so they force them to wear
	    masks to be bearable.</li>
	  <li>Abe used to cry a lot when he was a baby.  Fearing that he will be
	    slaughtered for being annoying, his mother Sam stitched his mouth
	    shut, which he keeps as a memento.</li>
	  <li>Because Vykkers are hermaphrodites and reproduce freely with
	    eachother.))</li>
	</ul>
      </div>

      <h2>Abbreviations</h2>
      <p> I'd like to mention a few of the most common abbreviations the
	community uses, which should make communication a bit easier.</p>

      <h2>Where to talk with others about Oddworld?</h2>
      <p>Of course none of this would mean much if you didn't have anyone else
	to talk to about the story. Here are a few communities where you can
	talk about the canon or anything else Oddworld related:</p>

      <div class="ul_container">
	<ul class="small">
	  <li><a href="https://discord.gg/oddworld">Official Oddworld</a> :: OWI's own
	    Discord. Currently this community has the largest active
	    fanbase and you can even chat with the developers here.</li>

	  <li><a href="http://discord.gg/JGeyUMn">OWF's Discord</a> :: The second
	    largest Discord, started by a few OWF community members. The
	    server has less rules and is because of this a lot more
	    laid-back.</li>

	  <li><a href="https://reddit.com/r/Oddworld">The Oddworld Reddit</a> :: A
	    relatively small Reddit community based around the game. While
	    it isn't particularly active, it does have a very loyal core
	    that comment under basically any kind of post.</li>

	  <li><a href="http://oddworldforums.net">OWF</a> :: Of course OWF is not only
	    a lore source, but also a place where you can talk about the
	    games. While the population of the site dropped considerably
	    throughout the years, but it's still a very important
	    community for discussing Oddworld.</li>
