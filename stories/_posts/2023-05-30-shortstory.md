Deep below the surface, inside one of the many damp, dripping tunnels
connecting one city to another, a fly and a worm bumped into each
other.

Through, to be entirely fair, it was only the Fly who did the bumping
part, as the Worm was entirely preoccupied with jamming his head deep
into a bucket of stinking, sickly pale meat, not unlike the color of
his own slightly undulating body. The enormous bucket was held between
the Worm's two flimsy arms, which looked comically small compared to
the gigantic size of the being.

The Worm pulled his head out of the bucket with some difficulty,
resulting in a wet 'pop', then looked at the Fly with his small, beady
eyes. They stood there in silence for a moment or two, the quiet
broken only by the occasional drip of sauce splattering against the
rough dirt floor. Finally the worm opened his foul-smelling mouth and
spoke in an entirely emotionless, yet somehow still questioning tone:

"What?"
{:.dialogue}

The Fly shuddered at the sudden sound, dropping a small, haphazardly
drawn map of the complex tunnel-system of the underground. Her many
large mammalian eyes, which just seconds ago have been busy reading
the aforementioned map, were now anxiously looking for the source of
the sound before settling on the dirty being who called out to her.

"I am terribly sorry for the intrusion, sir. I am absolutely at fault
here for not avoiding your..."---she stammered for a second looking
over the huge, bloated body of the Worm. As far as the Fly could see
the Worm's several meters thick torso filled all but a tight squeeze
in the tunnel. She wasn't looking forward to try how she'd fit through
the gap. ---"your generousness. You see, I was very focused on this
map."
{:.dialogue}

As far as she could tell, the Worm seemed completely unfazed. The Fly
was unsure whether he bought the false compliment or perhaps he did
not even notice her barely avoided impoliteness, but either way, she
was glad not to have invited his ire. The Worm let out his enormous
tongue and licked the dripping sauce off his chin before signaling
his acknowledgement with a grunt.

The Fly was a bit annoyed over the other's manners, but decided not to
mention it, since, after all, she had been the offending party.
Rather she asked the following:

"Since my clumsiness has already disturbed you, for which I am once
again truly sorry, could the sir please answer me a tiny question? Is
this Tunnel 3? I have spent most of today's morning looking for it,
but I got so lost, that I have decided in desperation to just take a
gamble and follow whichever path seemed most likely." She let out an
anxious titter, trying to ease her nervousness.
{:.dialogue}

The worm gulped once again and let out a thundering belch. "Tunnel 3?
Mm. No, this isn't it. Now leave me alone."
{:.dialogue}

The Fly was about to just give up and move on, but then she
reconsidered. As a descendant of an important trader family, her pride
triumphed over her modest upbringing. After all she showed utmost
politeness while this... nobody... this... beast handled her with
utmost disrespect. This was offense not even such a gentle soul as
her could endure.

Of course, there was a problem. Being only a measly two meters tall
and much more fragile than the Worm, a direct confrontation would have
only ended in a tragedy for the Fly. Her newfound nemesis could easily
unburden her face from half (if not all) of her eyes in a singular
chomp.

So instead the Fly decided she would use a more refined weapon. She
would teach this buffoon a lesson by mentioning something she would
have originally been too polite and meek to point out.

"I am very-very sorry, but there is one more thing I would like to ask
from the sir," she buzzed sweetly. "May I please look at the container
of the delicacy you're consuming?"
{:.dialogue}

The Worm let out a long, exasperated sigh, then shrugged. With a
forceful yank of his body, he turned halfway towards the Fly and
awkwardly held up the bucket, so the other could read it. The Fly
focused really hard to read the label as it was soaked in sauce and
the tunnel itself was quite dim too. It took several passes of her
many eyes to finally make out the text, but she was quite satisfied
when she finally managed to decipher it.

"_'GutCo: Mystery meat, Ready to eat'_, eh?" she smugly asked.
{:.dialogue}

The Worm now visibly irritated replied, "Yes. Is that all?"
{:.dialogue}

"Well... Not entirely, have you not felt anything wrong with your body
nowadays?" the Fly asked with the same cloyingly sweet, subtly
condescending tone.
{:.dialogue}

The Worm stared with a puzzled expression at the Fly, who feeling that
the moment was about to be spoiled, quickly continued with:

"Because, as it turns out, I just flew by a GutCo facility on my way
here. Built into your side. Dear sir, you are eating yourself. Does
this not unnerve you?"
{:.dialogue}

The Worm was silent for a second and the Fly's quietly snickered in
schadenfreude as she celebrated her victory. However, the Worm
suddenly threw his head back and let out a terrible laugh, which
echoed far into the tunnel.

"Ha! Well, in that case I sure taste delicious!" he bellowed, before pushing
his head back in the bucket.
{:.dialogue}

The Fly was speechless.

"How could a being be so simple to not even care about something like
this?" she thought, while a drip of mucus dripped from her proboscis
in frustration.
{:.dialogue}

Yet, there was no sign that the Worm would reemerge any time soon. The
Fly stood around for a few more seconds, hoping to somehow come out
on top, but eventually her patience ran out.

She let out something akin a sigh, turned around and left, leaving the
Worm to continue his blissful self-cannibalization.
