# New Site Logo

{% include caption.html url="/newlogo.webp" description="Woo!" %}

Today my site received a new logo, created by EyeMeat, a very talented artist
from the Discord. Before I talk more about it, I just want to put a little
memento here about the old one:

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/logos/logo.webp" description="The old logo." %}

This logo is an edit of a concept art from one of the unreleased movies. I am
not sure what exactly Abe and whoever's next to him is looking at, but I found
it pretty fitting, that similarly to how I try to 'illuminate' topics to the
fandom, they too are looking at something ancient and largely forgotten with
torches.

But ultimately as fond as I was about the metaphor, the logo still wasn't
excellent. It didn't really grab one's attention and I was using someone else's
work without permission as "branding".

However, all of these problems vanished when EyeMeat offered to draw me a new
logo and while I immediately said yes to the offer, we only got to it
yesterday. I quickly whipped up a *terrible*, but functional design plan to
show how I envisioned it and soon after we had an initial design.

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/logos/draft.png" description="A true work of art from me." %}

While it was great from the get go, there were some things that I wanted
differently, so we began a kind of back and forth, where I'd get a new design,
give feedback then get another one, until we finally iterated upon what you can
see above.

Finally we got a design we both liked which is now added to the site. I can
really recommend them, go commission something!

Here are some of the design variants we tried:

<div class="showcase">
    <img id="main_image" src="/imgs/logos/1.webp">
    <div id="rest">
    {% for i in (1..5) %}
        <img src="/imgs/logos/{{i}}.webp">
    {% endfor %}
    </div>
</div>
