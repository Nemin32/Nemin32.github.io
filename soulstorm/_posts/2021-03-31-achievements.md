# Achievements

Recently a website uploaded Soulstorm's achievements and while most of them aren't that useful,
there are a few very interesting names and events mentioned here. I'll now go over these, but
obviously this is deep spoiler territory. Leave now if you don't wish to be spoilt. If you wanna see
these achievements for yourself, you can do so [here.](https://www.exophase.com/game/oddworld-soulstorm-psn/trophies/)

Of course nothing here is fact, just my hopefully educated guesses based on what we know and
applying logic.

## The name of the "orb" in Abe's backpack

One of the achievements mentions the following:

> **Escaped The Mines:**
>
> Escaped the Necrum Mines with the Flagon's Eye

Now, I'm inclined to think this is what we've believed to be an egg / orb slotted inside Abe's bag.
It makes sense as it's the only vaguely eye shaped object we've seen over the years and it seems to
be a major [McGuffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin). I have no idea what (or who) a
Flagon is, the name is brand new.

## The dark area in Necrum is called "Sanctum"

> **High Stakes:**
>
> Complete The Sanctum without dying

The icon of this achievement is a flashlight. We've only seen a flashlight being used in the Necrum
area with the shadow creatures. Hence I think it's likely that this area is named Sanctum.

## About the the shadow creatures

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/epic/other.jpg" description="But then what *are* MeetleBats?" %}

Many people thought the shadow creatures inside Necrum are so called "MeetleBats" based on the item
name in Abe's inventory, however, one of the achievements contradicts this:

> **The Light, It Burns!:**
>
> Scared off at least 500 Sleeches

So apparently these creatures are called "Sleeches" (an obvious callback to Exoddus' Fleeches) and
this is likely what Lorne Lanning meant back in 2019 when he said that the Fleeches undervent major
changes:

> [**Lorne Lanning:**](/lanningqna) Last time you saw them they were in a larvae state. this time
> they have hatched into something way more creepy.

## Brew illness

> **Abe The Healer:**
>
> Discover, craft and use the antidote on 15 different sick Mudokons

Apparently despite the fact that emotions are cut from the game, it seems like brew-sickness will
return in some shape or form and Abe will be able to use an "antidote" to cure them.

## Name of the final level?

I'll admit I'm a bit shaky on this, but nonetheless, I think it's plausible that the last level of
the game is titled the "Eye of the Storm" as seen in this achievement:

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/achievements/storm.png" description="" %}

> **Savin' That Moolah:**
>
> Beat Eye Of The Storm without using a Vendo in that level

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/stateofplay/brewmaster.webp" description="" %}

The image of this achievement is the same device that's behind the Brewmaster in the [State of
Play](/stateofplay) trailer. And considering the Brewery is likely to be the last area in the game,
I think it's most likely that the achivement belong to its last level.

## There are only two ladder sections in the game

This one is also heavy speculation, but I think it's plausible that there are only two sections
in the game where you have to defend Mudokons who are climbing up a ladder as there are only two
achievements related to this mechanic:

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/achievements/td1.webp" description="" %}

> **Friend of the Mudokons, Part 1:**
>
> Rescued enough Mudokons for good Quarma in Reunion At The Old Trellis

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/achievements/td2.webp" description="" %}

> **Friend of the Mudokons, Part 2:**
>
> Rescued enough Mudokons for good Quarma in the Escape level

I am personally very much not a fan of these sections even by their looks, so I'd be very happy if
they're used extremely sparingly.

## Conclusion

I find it weird that none of the achievements mention these "Chi-charms" which were mentioned
previously. I wonder if they're even in the game still. There is one called "Ch'i master," but I'm
unsure if it's related.

I'm also a bit surprised there are only this few achievements as I would have imagined the game will
have at least one for each location. I also find it curious how one of the achievements mentions
Sekto Springs, a location in Stranger's Wrath. I know the game isn't explicitly retconned and it was
said it could work in both continuities, but a direct callback is still unexpected.

The achievements also seem to imply there are only two endings as opposed to the commonly mentioned
theory of having a good/neutral/bad one.

I also found the portal reference in "Now You're Thinking With Bird Portals" mildly amusing.
