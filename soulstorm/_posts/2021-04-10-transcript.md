## Intro

### Inside the Train

**Toby:** [Screams] Faster, Alf! We gotta go faster! FAAASTER!

**Alf:** I'm going as fast as I can Toby! Fast as I can!

**Toby:** Oh... Alf... Alf, I think you need to see this.

**Alf:** Toby...?

**Toby:** It's the end of the line, Alf.

**Alf:** Holy shit!

**Alf:** Abe! Open up! Open up, Abe! Aaaabe! Aaaabe!

**Abe:** [Muttering] What do I do now?

**12 HOURS EARLIER**

### Outside in the desert

**Wounded Worker:** Ugh... Abe? Ouch.

### Inside Monsiac Lines

**Freed Slave:** They came creeping up just like this, And then, and then, and then... Whammo!
Slignuggets! [Laughs]


**Audience:** Oh wow! / That's great! / I love Abe!

**Another Slave:** Take that Slugface! We all slipped through.

**His friend:** Hahaha, that's awesome!

**All of them:** Here's to Abe! [clinks glasses] Yeah! Oh, I love Abe!

### Inside the Shaman's tent

**Shaman:** You must, Abe!

**Abe:** But it's the only memory of her that I have!

**Shaman:** You cannot face what's ahead, if you choose to hold on to those strings of oppression!
You must find and embrace your full voice! You must do it!

**Abe:** B-but she was real! She gave me these and no one else even remembers her or-

**Shaman:** You are no longer a slave, Abe! You have worn those your entire life. For you and the
others were under a spell. Living your lives inside of lies upon lies until finally it was a
terrible truth you discovered, that broke your mind free. Now...now you must grow! We curse the
Glukkon's testimony. May it seep paranoia and distrust, through his peers. For he who has finally
come. May their confusion provide safe passage.

**Abe:** But how can I just?

**Shaman:** Your voice must grow, for the lies to fade! The spell that deceived you must break
entirely if you are to face what's coming.

**Abe:** But we're free now! I just need some time-

**Shaman:** You have no time! Your voice they believed, trusted, followed and it led them here. But
even you have yet to fully embrace it. But you must, you must, now! Or our chance will be lost. You
may have escaped the murderous blades, but not the shackles you chain to yourself.

**Abe:** But it's over! RuptureFarms is burned down! We're free now!

**Shaman:** No, Abe. [Waggles finger] Not over. Just beginning!

**Abe:** But I'm so tired! They're all tired!

**Shaman:** There is no rest!

**Abe:** But I want some time!

**Shaman:** There is no time!

**Abe:** But we're safe now!

**Shaman:** Only for you few and only for this moment! But...this moment [mimics slitting own throat
with finger] is over.

[Shots in the background, Mudokons panic]

**Freed Slave:** [Whispering] We're discovered!

**Shaman:** I am sorry, Abe. But it really is up to you! Now it begins Abe! The fate of your entire
people is up to you! [Gets crushed by a bunch of logs]

## Molluck's Return

**Molluck:** What are they doing? Did those fugitive morons burn down their own hideout?,

**Slig Pilot:** It sounds idiotic but that's exactly what it looks like.

**Molluck:** Haha, Bad Quarma for burnin' down my farm, ha. Okay! First we whack that blue
bastard, then we can finally clear my name and make things right with our creepy Magog Cartel
investors.

**Slig Pilot:** Those guys terrify me, boss.

**Molluck:** That's why we're here. So we can get to Abe before they can get to us. Alright, now I
want your Slig pals positioned all around this place, cause we are not letting that Abe guy get
away from us again!

**Slig Pilot:** You got it, Boss!

## Messenger

**Messenger:** Huh? Abe? Abe.

**Abe:** You know me?

**Messenger:** Abe, soon the whole Oddworld will know you.

**Abe:** I'm sorry. I- I don't know how to help you.

**Messenger:** But you can! You can, help us all! I thought I'd never reach you. But, but you came,
Abe! And... And you... you found me! You found me.

**Abe:** I'm so, I'm so sorry, I-I can't save you.

**Messenger:** But... but you... but you can. You... you can save them all. But the others...
already dying!

**Abe:** Who?

**Messenger:** Followers! Your followers! They know...

**Abe:** Know what?

**Messenger:** You must... must... find... must find the Keeper.

**Abe:** The others!

## Train #2

**Alf:** Abe, I don't know how ya did it but... unbelievable!

**Abe:** I tell ya it was... He knows how to drive a train?

**Alf:** He swiped the manuals, out of shipping years ago. He's been reading them ever since.

**Abe:** Huh... Oh, I was given this from a Mudokon escapee from Necrum Mines. He died looking
for us.

**Alf:** Abe, that's terrible. What's that, a map?

**Abe:** Huh, I guess it is. And this came with it.

**Alf:** Woah!

**Abe:** Creepy, right?

**Alf:** Yea, creepy.

**Abe:** With his last breath, he said they're all dying.

**Alf:** Who's dying?

**Abe:** Our followers. They're all dying.

**Alf:** What do you mean our followers?

**Abe:** I think he means, since we fled the farm, rumors have been spreading, throughout the
factories. Mudokons have started escaping, and now they're trying to find us.

**Alf:** I told you that would happen. Anything else?

**Abe:** I found some sick Mudokons. They escaped from other factories,, but they were dying.
All of them were dying. With their help, I discovered an antidote. I made some medicine and it
fixed them,, but I still don't know why they got sick.

**Alf:** Nothing else?

**Abe:** He said we needed to find the Keeper.

**Messenger:** The Keeper...

**Alf:** What's the Keeper? Um, what's it doing?

**Abe:** I don't know. I...

**Both:** Whoa!

**Alf:** Oh, look at that. Look where it's shining. Even though the train is bouncing around,
the light stays right on Necrum.

**Abe:** The Keeper?

**Alf:** I hope it ain't telling us-,

**Abe:** the Keeper is in Necrum.

**Alf:** Nobody wants to go to Necrum.

**Toby:** Slig Barracks coming up! What are we going to do?

**Abe:** I also found another guy. He left a note for me. He said we got to know what's on this
tape.

**Alf:** Is that an old Blahtta tape?

**Toby:** Not too old. They still use them, at Communication Outposts.

**Alf:** Okay, lookie here! Slig Barracks is the next stop on this line. It should have a
communications outpost shouldn't it?

**Toby:** Yup.

**Alf:** If we don't take out that Comm Tower,, then every factory ahead of us, including Necrum
Mines... They going to know we're coming.

**Abe:** But first I got to play this tape.

**Alf:** Yup, you got to play that tape.

## Slig Barracks

**Slig Pilot:** Let's go! Let's go!

**Molluck:** He's getting away! Again.

**Slig Pilot:** Sorry, Boss, it's a miracle this, heap of crap delivery death trap, has made it
even this far. It's just all you had left.

**Molluck:** What's the next stop?,

**Slig Pilot:** Oh, uh, well that would, uh... Slig Barracks, Boss! And maybe while we're there
we can, pick up some reinforcements, you know. I mean, we did kind of... lose a lot of good
guys back there, and-

**Molluck:** Bunch of idiots couldn't stop one stinking slave.

**Slig Pilot:** Well, uh, little harsh maybe, Boss. I mean, I know you been working,Enfin,
your whole life to retire on one of those mega luxury air-yachts and all,, and I know this Abe guy
burned that dream to smithereens.

**Molluck:** Pft!

**Slig Pilot:** But, maybe... maybe we clean this all up,, and you can still afford one of them
economy models. You know, you buy it used off of E-Crappy?

**Molluck:** Get us to Slig Barracks. Do it!

**Slig Pilot:** Of course. Boss. I'm trying. I'm trying till I'm dying. We are gonna bring, this
puppy home we're gonna... bring this puppy home!

## Brewmaster

### On the tape

**Brewmaster:** Greetings wise investors of the esteemed Magog Cartel.

**Brewmaster:** What I propose to you today is the ultimate employee performance and job retainment
solution.

**Brewmaster:** For years it has been my quest to find the upper limits of Mudokon labor
capabilities as well as their potential addiction dependencies so that tomorrow, your conglomerates
of factories may profit from maximized labor performance chemically induced loyalty and the end to
labor escape whistleblowers and those costly PR nightmare blowbacks.

**Brewmaster:** Only Soulstorm Brew takes performance chemical dependency, and profitability to
entirely new levels and sustains them.

**Brewmaster:** Our solution is simple; Two Brews a day keeps job performance at peek operability
but if that laborer ever makes a run for it within 48 hours of not having access to our beloved Brew
their withdrawals will have kicked in and become so severe that in only a few hours the little
wanna-be whistleblowing ingrates will be dead.

**Abe:** Dying?

**Brewmaster:** They will not be running to the cities because they will die before they ever get
there.

**Brewmaster:** They will not be meeting with Union Representatives because they will never reach
one.

**Brewmaster:** They will not be causing you PR nightmares because they will be dead.

### Abe after he watched the tape

**Abe:** Oh, no. The Followers... They're all dying from the Brew!

**Slig:** You! Freeze! Hold it right there.

## Morguer

### On Molluck's airship

**Molluck:** How can this weak, pathetic, uneducated schmuck of a slave still manage to be alive?,

**Slig Pilot:** I don't know boss, but that creepy dude is some kind of supernatural, I tell ya.
I wouldn't of believed it had I not seen it with my own eyes, when my best friendsies got taken
over by some kind of, mind control and suddenly they, start blowing each other away! Pow, pow-pow,
pow, pow! It was so disturbing.

**Slig Pilot:** I don't know boss, but maybe the Brew ain't working on that one?,

**Molluck:** Brew was our insurance. Our guarantee that would prevent anything like this from ever
happening.

**Slig Pilot:** But it is happening,, and we're past that creep's expiration date. Unless they
had Brew with them,, how do you explain it?,

**Molluck:** Maybe the Brewmaster's solution is failing us?,

### In Morguer's office

**Slig Newscaster:** Welcome back to News For Your Blues. Following up on our top story how Molluck
the Glukkon deceived his own investors after burning down, his own farm for the insurance moolah in
a truly diabolical act.

**Slig Newscaster:** Now we expect Gluks to be greedy,, heck we even bank on it, but this Gluk,
doesn't just take the cake, he steals the whole cake delivery blimp,, then makes a run for it.
Here at the site of the once, top performing meat farm on Mudos, now just a smoldering disaster
area, that has suffered massive casualties,, a charge some call the mass murder, of a loyal labor
force betrayed by, the Glukkon that they...

**Slig Intercom:** Hello, Mr. Morguer, Security Chief here.

**Morguer:** Have you been able to reach the Brewmaster, yet?,

**Slig Intercom:** Sorry, sir, but the Communication Lines seem to be down all along the Z-line.

**Morguer:** Hm, how often does that happen?

**Slig Intercom:** Only once that I know of, and that was a hurricane.

**Slig Intercom:** One other thing though. There's this conspiracy theory floating around, about an
uprising at RuptureFarms. Claims some PTSD Slig survivors,, they've been rambling on about, a
supernatural slave took out Molluck's place, and escaped with the rest of the slaves.

**Slig Intercom:** Says they didn't die there. Thought you should know.

**Morguer:** Hm... Would Molluck really burn his own farm down,, or is the Brew failing us?,

**Slig Intercom:** Er, Mr. Morguer... I know we're in a creepy business,, digging up bones and
stuff,, but, sir, that's the most terrifying thing I have ever heard you say.

**Morguer:** Keep trying to get a hold of the Brewmaster. Alert me when you get him.

**Slig Intercom:** You can count on me-

## Catacombs In

**The Keeper:** They've always known you would come. Do you know why you have?

**Abe:** I, uh, are you The Keeper?

**The Keeper:** We're all Keepers here. Since the beginning.

**Abe:** What do all you keep?

**The Keeper:** We keep the oldest things, Abe. Dangerous things. Each other and the secrets.

**Abe:** The secrets?

**The Keeper:** Secrets of crimes hidden throughout time, long since buried in lies. Lies you know
as history.

**The Keeper:** A false history, written in our blood. These walls hold the memory of what
happened. What really happened. For the Keepers remember everything!

**The Keeper:** Their memories are most dangerous things. Things that would threaten, even the most
powerful bloodlines, that rule the industries of Oddworld. They would destroy this place, if ever
it were discovered.

**The Keeper:** This is why our Keepers, their memories, must remain hidden. Must stay secret.
But only for so long as it takes you to unleash, what's coming.

**Abe:** What's coming? What do they know?

**The Keeper:** They know what you need to know, Abe. But you are unable to see it... just yet.

**Abe:** Just yet?

**The Keeper:** When you return with the Stone of the Fragon's Eye,, only then can you see.

**Abe:** Return? Return from where?

**The Keeper:** The depths.

**Abe:** Down there?

**The Keeper:** Down there. Where you can return with the Eye and receive the branding. So you can
see.

**Abe:** The branding?

**The Keeper:** Mm-hm. And it will go right... there!

**Abe:** Oof, oh, no! Ah!

**The Keeper:** You can return with the Eye, Abe. As long as you remember, they don't like the
light.

## Catacombs Out

**Abe:** Hello?, Keeper? Hello?

**The Keeper:** Go to the center of the lake, Abe. Find yourself at the center. Find yourself and
see. It's the only way you will know.

**The Keeper:** Forgive us, Abe. It was the only way. To behold such terrible truth... So much for a
heart to bear.

**Abe:** Why would they? How could they?

**The Keeper:** I'm so sorry, Abe, but you needed to know who we really are what happened to us,,
and what's at stake if you don't succeed.

**The Keeper:** You must taint the Brew, Abe,, for the Brew is what keeps the rest enslaved.

**The Keeper:** Break its spell with your remedy, or our kind will never be free.

**The Keeper:** Break the spell, for what good is a poison, that's tainted with its cure.

## Train #3

**Alf:** You see all those pipes out there? Those are the Brew Pipelines. They start at Soulstorm
Brewery, where all that Brew starts getting pumped out, to all those factories across Mudos. Imagine
that.

**Alf:** Abe! How'd you do?,

**Abe:** We got problems.

**Alf:** You think? It gets worse?

**Abe:** Much, much worse. I played it.

**Alf:** Aw, shit.

**Abe:** Now I know why the others are dying. It's the Brew. It's killing them!

**Alf:** That's ridiculous. Brew never killed nobody. We been drinking it all our lives.

**Abe:** That's just it. It's when we don't have Brews. That's when we get sick, because the
Brew,, it's designed to kill us if we ever escape.

**Alf:** But we're ok and we escaped?

**Abe:** But only because you stashed Brews for us, when we split the farm. Then the train we
stole, had Brews on it and we got lots more. But when we run out...

**Abe & Alf:** We're screwed.

**Alf:** But you said you crafted a cure.

**Abe:** But only in little doses. Not enough for a whole continent, full of factories full of
slaves! And a lot more rumors will be spreading, after what we done today.

**Alf:** With lots more escapes,, and lots more dying.

**Abe:** I need to find The Keeper. We got to get to Necrum.

**Alf:** It's the next stop, Abe.

## Train #4

**Alf:** Hey, Abe! You had us worried! We're gettin low on Brews. Woah, check that out!

**Abe:** Oh, uh, guys, it's worse than we thought.

**Alf:** What's that?,

**Abe:** All we've been taught,, our whole lives in the factories, everything we thought we
knew, it's all lies, but the truth... We're not just the schmucks we always thought we were.
We're something much, much more

**Abe:** and, but... But, right now, we got to survive. And what the Keeper said we need to-

**Alf:** You found the Keeper?,

**Abe:** I did, and she told us what to do, but what she meant, I can't figure out.

**Alf:** Who- Wait? She? Was she hot?,

**Abe:** Alf, no. She was the oldest thing I've ever seen.

**Alf:** Oh...Oh...Oh ...Oh... Well, what'd she say?,

**Abe:** She said we needed to taint the Brew, because it keeps us all enslaved, but we knew that.

**Alf:** Did she say anything else?

**Abe:** Well, she said, For what good is a poison,, if it's tainted with its cure. But
what does that mean?,

**Alf:** It's doing that creepy stuff again.

**Abe:** Those are ingredients. I wrote them down when I was figuring out, how to craft medicine
for the sick guys. But I... The ingredients. It's like they are, all swirling into the Brewery.

**Alf:** Does it want us to mix them into the Brewery?,

**Abe:** What good is a poison, if it's tainted with its cure?,

**Alf:** Wait. The Brewery pumps Brew, out to all the factories in Mudos. Maybe it's telling us to
mix your medicine, into the Brew before it gets pumped out, to all those factories?

**Abe:** But I only crafted the medicine in small doses. How would we ever find enough to mix it,
for all those factories and all those slaves?

**Alf:** But you already got the recipe,, and it's only five ingredients.

**Abe:** But how will we get enough to match dose Mudos's biggest Brewery?

**Toby:** How about FeeCo Depot?,

**Alf & Abe:** What?

**Toby:** FeeCo Depot. It's close by on the Z-Line, and its switch-track is coming up.

**Abe:** But FeeCo's a freight yard, not a deep dark abandoned mine shaft, like where I found the
stuff.

**Alf:** I don't know, Abe. Anything manufactured on Oddworld passes
through, places like FeeCo Depot every day. And all those ingredients you wrote down?, I'm pretty
sure they're all used by food, drug,, and make up companies, aren't they?

**Abe:** I guess they are.

**Alf:** Toby, if we can get Abe into FeeCo Depot,,Toby, then maybe we can get some favors, from
some old buddies still slaving away there,, and they could ID the right containers and Abe can
help them load onto this train. Then, run this train right up that Brewery's-,

**Abe:** Maybe that's it.

**Alf:** If we don't do this now.

**Abe:** We got to try.

**Abe & Alf:** Let's do it!

## Aslik & Brewmaster

### On Molluck's airship

**Molluck:** Looks like that Abe guy tore up the place. What's the next facility them tracks is
headed to?

**Slig Pilot:** Um, let's see, that's um, FeeCo Depot.

**Molluck:** FeeCo Depot? We got to hurry. Go faster! If we don't stop that Abe guy,, I'll get
blamed for this disaster down there, too.

**Slig Pilot:** You got it, Boss!

### In Aslik's office

**Aslik:** What? You know this is my nap hour!

**Slig Security:** Uh, sorry to bother you, Mr. Aslik, but, uh, there's these rumors been
spreading around about uprisings and train hijackings and-,

**Aslik:** You woke me for rumors?, For silly conspiracy theories?,

**Slig Security:** Well, but the guys they're-they're pretty freaked out and they're-,

**Aslik:** Damn it! There is no Abe guy! There is no uprising! Molluck burned down his own damn
farm. We know this because never in history has a Mudokon beaten a Glukkon, ever!

**Slig Security:** Oh, uh, of course you're right Mr. Aslik, I mean- I didn't mean to-

**Aslik:** Hmpft! They'll believe anything.

### In the Brewmaster's office

**Brewmaster:** What is it now?

**Wolvark:** Excuse me, sir, but I thought you should know. There's these rumors circulating.
Hijackings, uprisings, instantaneous combustion. Creepy stuff... Troops are getting worried. So
me and the boys was thinking, that maybe we should-,

**Brewmaster:** Don't!

**Wolvark:** Uh, excuse me sir?

**Brewmaster:** Don't think! It makes you say stupid things!, For decades my Brew has insured,
against such possibilities.

**Wolvark:** Well, what if it ain't working anymore?

**Brewmaster:** You dare suggest my Brew isn't working?,

**Wolvark:** Uh... ya... uh...

**Brewmaster:** But don't I pay you to suppress rumors?,

**Wolvark:** Uh, well, uh, yeah... Yeah you do, sir.

**Brewmaster:** Well then do it! This makes no sense. My Brew has, always worked there must be some
other.... Molluck! Molluck! This is his doing. His plot has failed, and to save himself, he's
trying to blame my Brew! That traitor!

## Train #5 #1

### In the train

**Alf:** Huh? That's weird. Brews is all we got to keep speed up, and reach the Brewery

**Alf:** but we're using up the last of our stash, Abe! I hope you got a plan, Abe!, Abe, you
got a plan, right?

### In the Brewmaster's office

**Brewmaster:** How dare anyone question my recipe. It has never failed us, never! It must be
Molluck. Who else would be spreading these fake rumors?, These conspiracy theories!

**Brewmaster:** What?

**Wolvark:** Uh, sorry to bother you again.

**Brewmaster:** What is it?

**Wolvark:** There's, uh, two Glukkon's that have arrived by airship. They're waiting on your
helipad.

**Brewmaster:** Two what?

**Wolvark:** Glukkons, sir. They're kind of freaking out, pissed off and all, and they're
demanding you meet with them.

**Brewmaster:** Demanding? You tell them they can wait! Molluck! I know he's behind this.

## Train #5 #2

### In the train

**Toby:** Faster, Alf! We got to go faster!

**Alf:** I'm going fast as I can, Toby. Fast as I can.

**Alf:** Abe! open up! Open up, Abe! Abe! Abe!

**Abe:** What do I do? What do I do now?

**Alf:** Abe!

**Abe:** Wow. Ahhh!!

**Alf:** Abe? Abe? What's happening to you?

### The perimeter of Soulstorm Brewery

**Slig Soldier:** Holy crap!

**Slig Soldier:** Screw this!

**Slig Soldier:** It's that Abe guy, right there.

**Slig Soldier:** You're dead meat now!

**Abe:** Argh!

**Slig Soldier:** Holy shit!

**Slig Soldier:** Mommy!

**Slig Soldier:** No! No! No!

## Bad Ending

### In the train

**Toby:** Faster, Alf! We got to go faster!

**Alf:** I'm going fast as I can, Toby. Fast as I can

**Alf:** Abe, open up. Open up, Abe! Abe!

**Voice:** So much for her heart to bear.

**Abe:** No. No. No. No! No. No. No! Oh, I did this.

**Alf:** Abe!

**Abe:** Huh?

**Alf:** Abe? You got to help us! We need more Brew, now! Now!

**Alf:** Without more Brews we'll never, make it inside that Brewery!

**Abe:** I... I killed it.

**Alf:** But you did your best, right, Abe?

**Abe:** My Quarma... it... it killed it...

**Alf:** No!

**Toby:** Hehe, I got it!

**Abe:** Ahh!

### On Molluck's airship

**Molluck:** What the...

**Molluck:** No, no, no! Not the Brewery!

**Slig Pilot:** Oh, wow!

**Molluck:** This is bad. They're going to frame it on me again.

**Slig Pilot:** Boss, they annihilated the place, and look at those pipelines. They're on fire and
spreading. What're we going to do now, Boss?

**Molluck:** We head for the Yaymans.

**Slig Pilot:** The Yaymans!? We're really going to run for it, Boss?

**Molluck:** Nothing left for us here except convictions and firing squads.

**Slig Pilot:** Aw, man! Now you'll never get that luxury airship, that you've been dreaming of all
your life. Not even a crappy one!

**Slig Newscaster:** Welcome to News for your Blues!

**Slig Pilot:** B-boss!?

**Slig Newscaster:** Tonight we kick off with the latest...

**Slig Pilot:** Uh, I didn't mean it.... Please stop! No, Boss! No!

## Good Ending #1

### On Molluck's airship

**Molluck:** That Abe guy, he's there all right, and by the sounds of it,, that Brewery's getting
wrecked, but who's limo blimps are those on the helipad?, That one's Morguer's and the other...
It's that idiot Aslik's.

**Slig Pilot:** So, uh, what do we do now, boss?

**Molluck:** Get us above the place. We need to find out what's going on.

**Slig Pilot:** Whoa, uh, how ya thinking we gonna pull that off? Boss? But, boss, there's got to be
a better plan!

### Outside the airship, above the Brewery

**Molluck:** It'll work! Now all ya gotta do is zip down, sneak in, find Brewmaster, spy on what's
up,, report back to me. It's easy! Do it!

**Slig Pilot:** If you say so, boss.

**Slig Pilot:** Easy? So says the guy with no #%$@ arms.

## Good Ending #2

### Outside the Brewmaster's office

**Aslik:** Morguer? I thought the bone harvesting business was treating you well.

**Morguer:** We were fools to ever have believed in his Brew. Or in him.

**Aslik & Morguer:** Wait here!

**Slig:** Yes, sir.

**Slig:** Yeah, you bet.

### Inside the Brewmaster's office

**Brewmaster:** And to what bad Quarma do I owe that brings the two of you here?

**Aslik:** Brewmaster!

**Morguer:** Your recipe is a disaster.

**Aslik:** We have lost our factories! And we demand to know...

**Morguer:** How you intend to compensate us?,

**Brewmaster:** You dare accuse me?

**Morguer:** It's your Brew that has failed us.

**Brewmaster:** My recipe is flawless! Do you inbreds not see that my Brew is under attack!

**Morguer:** As were our operations.

**Aslik:** We barely escaped our own premises alive!

**Morguer:** And only one day after Molluck's farm disaster. Isn't that curious?,

**Aslik:** And now you're suffering uprising as well!

**Brewmaster:** You pathetic pawns! Don't you see we've been betrayed? This is Molluck's doing! His
slaves didn't die in the farm. He's using them as an army to take us all down. He's attacking us
to cover his own tracks, and, right now, he's attacking my Brew blaming it all on the imaginary Abe
guy.

### Outside the Brewmaster's office and on Molluck's airship

**Slig Pilot:** Hey Boss, you catching this?,

**Molluck:** I knew they'd blame it on me. Did you bribe some backup?

**Slig Pilot:** Even more than I expected. Turns out those two idiots been stiffing, their own
security Sliggies out of OT and bonuses. Now they hate these clowns as much as you do, Boss, ha!

**Molluck:** Good. Very good. Now you know what to do. Now, do it!

**Slig Pilot:** I do. We all do. But, first, they, uh...

**Slig Pilot:** We need some assurances.

**Molluck:** What kind of assurances?

**Slig Pilot:** Well, for one, I needs to know that my bonus is secure.

**Molluck:** Grr, and?

**Slig Pilot:** And these guys wanna to fly to the Yaymans and hang out with us until all this blows
over.

**Molluck:** Nothing else?

**Slig Pilot:** They wanna be made whole on all the bonuses, they got scammed out of. They do this,
they wanna know you're gonna make it up to them.

**Molluck:** You tell them...

**Molluck:** We're in this together!

**Slig Pilot:** Okay, I'll tell em, Boss!

**Slig Pilot:** Who's your daddy?

**Sligs:** Yes! Alright!

**Brewmaster:** And now you can see my security is getting hammered out there. You both brought
security Sligs. How many can you contribute?

**Morguer:** I have a dozen fierce and loyal Sliggies, all awaiting my command.

**Sligs:** Ha, that's what he thinks. Idiot. Ha!

**Aslik:** I've got as many awaiting my command.

**Sligs:** Not anymore we ain't! Ha-ha-ha.

**Sligs:** Oh, my God.

**Sligs:** So stupid.

### Inside the Brewmaster's office

**Brewmaster:** Well, then, if we execute our forces with precision, we'll thwart Molluck's plan,
quash his fake rebellion, and expose the fraudulent fiend for all of our financiers to see.

**Morguer:** Ah, and there's my Lieutenant and his team, now.

**Aslik:** And there's my Sergeant-at-arms, with his shock team, just in time!

**Brewmaster:** Good, now that you're all here! Come forth and get your orders. Well, what are you
waiting for?

**Slig Pilot:** Hey guys, you want to get possessed, by that supernatural freak, reeking havoc
out there,, or are we flying to the Yaymans, and sipping frosty poladas on a humid beach?,

**Sligs:** Yaymans! Here we go!

**Aslik & Morguer:** No! No!

### Outside Soulstorm Brewery

**Alf:** I don't get it. We stalled out hours ago. Why ain't they chasin' us?

**Abe:** Well we can hardly believe we really, did what we really did today. Maybe they can't
either.

**Alf:** So what else did you learn down there with that Keeper?

**Abe:** So much but we've got... a mother.

**Alf:** Du-duh all critters got mothers.

**Abe:** No, I mean, we all have THE SAME mother. All of us... from RuptureFarms.

**Alf:** Is that even possible?

**Abe:** It has to be, because that's what happened.

**Alf:** But why would she...

**Abe:** I don't know why she left us. But I do know where she is.

**Alf:** Alive? But we were all told our mothers... were dead.

**Abe:** They lied to us about everything. And she's not dead. But she's... she's just

**Alf:** She's what, Abe?

**Abe:** She's in... Nolybab!

**Toby:** I don't even know no one who's ever even been to Nolybab.

**Alf:** A city full of Gluks. It just ain't right.

**Abe:** We gotta find her... because we need to know... why she left us... in that horrible place.

**Abe:** And why she gave me these.
