# The IGN Soulstorm gameplay segment

Two days after the first E3 interview, we got to see a much longer segment of
Oddworld: Soulstorm. The video contains most of the scenes we saw in the
previous trailer, so I would rather focus on things that we haven't seen
previously. In case you're out of the loop, you can read my previous writeup
[here](/e3).

![](/imgs/ign/train.jpg)

As I've previously theorized, Abe really does arrive using that train to the
level.

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/objective.jpg" description='"Are we rushing in? Or are we going sneaky-beaky like?"' %}

We get to see more of the UI in the form of help-bubbles and a screen
explaining the mission objective to us.

![](/imgs/ign/binoculars.jpg)

Abe runs past a pair of binoculars. The help-text explains, that it can be
used to survey the rest of the level and to shoot darts. As seen previously,
these darts can be used to knock out Sligs. I'm not a hundred percent sure
whether this is lethal or non-lethal, but personally I'm inclined to think
it won't kill them.

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/door.jpg" description="Since levels now have multiple levels of depth, doors were reimagined to be short-distance teleporters, that beam Abe from one place to another using lightning bolts." %}

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/mural.jpg" description="A mural showing a Mudokon carrying a huge cog on his shoulders. This image is very similar to the titan <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(mythology)'>Atlas</a> from Greek-mythology." %}

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/gumrot.jpg" description="Right after Abe leaves the teleporter-door, we see a familiar old poster advertising Gum Rot. The poster also has a Fuzzle on it, which likely means that they're still canon and perhaps even part of the game." %}

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/dripik.jpg" description=" Even through he's just a placeholder, you surely won't scroll any further without first cherishing General Dripik.  " %}

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/hardhat.jpg" description=" Mudokon in hardhat squatting.  " %}

To visually convey Mudokons joining Abe, they now have little yellow
hardhats, that they throw away, when Abe calls to them.

The new Gamespeak appears to have two calls (there might be more, but
this footage only showed two) a green call and a red one. The green is
basically a combination of "All of you!" and "Follow me!", while the red one
is "Wait!".

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/positive.jpg" description=" Positive Quarma forming around the freshly-freed Mudokon." %}

Abe calls to the Mudokon and we can see a small yellow shine appear and fly
into him. This is how Quarma is represented now. Later we'll see how negative
Quarma looks like.

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/poss.jpg" description=" The screen visibly blurs as the orb leaves Abe and there is a noticeable color-shift." %}

We then get to see possession. I have to say, my opinion about it is mixed.
While the graphical effect beats miles on New 'n' Tasty's "Mandala", it's
still far less iconic compared to Oddysee's and Exoddus' blue spirit balls. I
especially dislike the possession orb, which looks way out of the place and
when it possesses the unfortunate Slig, it doesn't even look like it's
"invading the mind" or something, rather just makes a quick lap around it and
it's done.

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/leave.jpg" description='As the Slig gets unpossessed, the orb is once again controllable, albeit only for a very short time. As Lanning explained, it will be possible to "chain-possess" multiple Sligs.' %}

Possession is now time limited. I'm not sure whether I like this or not yet,
so I'm reserving judgement. Also as the devs explained previously, you may
have the choice to either gib or just knock out your target.

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/pistons.jpg" description=" Pistons serve as an environmental hazard in this puzzle. Jump at the wrong time and you're toast." %}

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/jelly.jpg" description="Jelly." %}

Abe picks up a "Royal Jelly". For those who might not know, [Royal Jelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_jelly)
in real life is a kind of substance bees and other hive-creatures feed to those
larvae, who are destined to be queens. This causes changes in their bodies and
makes reproduction possible. <br><br> However, as we can see here it just increases
Abe's max health. Even so, I'm curious about the implications. As we know
there is at least one Mudokon queen, Sam, who is held captive by the Vykkers
and Glukkons. Maybe Abe is collecting this for her or to create a new
queen?

The player uses a jawbreaker enveloped in rubber bands to knock out a Slig,
who's holding a lever, not letting him proceed. The non-lethal take down nets
Abe one Quarma.

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/delivery.jpg" description='Abe and his Muds board a "Content Delivery System", which lets them travel between layers of the map.' %}

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/boxes.jpg" description="<i>Whack!</i>" %}

As they arrive at the next layer, we can observe Abe breaking some boxes by
striking them with his hands. Perhaps in a time of great need melee is an
option too?

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/orb.jpg" description=' The new Security Orb design' %}

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/gore.jpg" description="Abe has just performed a 'gory' kill." %}

Abe murders a Slig in cold blood by using possession, netting him a
large sum of negative Quarma. This ain't Exoddus anymore, killing Sligs is
now undesirable. Unless, of course, if you want to achieve the bad ending.

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/muds.jpg" description="The gang's all here!" %}

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/medium.jpg" description=' Uh-oh.' %}

Abe calls a large number of Mudokons to himself, who leave their workplaces.
The alarm immediately goes to Medium, which means that the guard posts
will start spewing out Sligs.

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/pop.jpg" description='By throwing multiple "Fizzy PoPs" the player can destroy fragile floors and walls, without starting a fire. And it can also make for a stylish entrance.' %}

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/rung.jpg" description=' "Oh, I wonder who this might be?"' %}

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/rip.jpg" description=' "This was a terrible idea!"' %}

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/negative.jpg" description=' Your actions have repercussions...' %}

A Slig gets possessed and by triggering the little bell above the guard post,
another Slig is spawned, who is then perforated. This results in a huge hit of
negative Quarma, which is represented by many black blotches flying into
Abe.

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/reload.jpg" description=' Instead of being jerked back, Sligs now have to reload between firefights.' %}

Abe continues his rampage using the Slig, until he is dispatched. Afterwards
he crafts a flamethrower, whose recipe has changed since EGX 2017.

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/flamethrower.jpg" description="It's original recipe was a bottle of SoulStorm Brew + an extinguisher + a lighter." %}

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/flames.jpg" description="You've done it now." %}

With the flamethrower, he kills many Sligs. Amusingly, death by fire only
gives Abe 7 negative Quarma.

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/bounce.jpg" description="It is shown that you can ring guard post bells with Abe's throwables too, like jawbreakers." %}

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/ign/ouch.jpg" description="Yeah, that's not gonna end well." %}

In the final scene we see Abe and the Mudokons trying to avoid a train flying
past them, however, they fail. But before we could see them being gibbed, the
camera fades to show Lorne Lanning and the interviewer again.
