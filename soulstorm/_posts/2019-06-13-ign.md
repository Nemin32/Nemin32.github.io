      <h1>The IGN Soulstorm gameplay segment</h1>

      <p>Two days after the first E3 interview, we got to see a much longer segment of
        Oddworld: Soulstorm. The video contains most of the scenes we saw in the
        previous trailer, so I would rather focus on things that we haven't seen
        previously. In case you're out of the loop, you can read my previous writeup
        <a href="e3">here</a>.</p>
    </header>
    <main>
      <img src="imgs/ign/train.jpg">

      <p>As I've previously theorized, Abe really does arrive using that train to the
        level.</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/objective.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle">"Are we rushing in? Or are we going sneaky-beaky like?"</p>

      <p>We get to see more of the UI in the form of help-bubbles and a screen
        explaining the mission objective to us.</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/binoculars.jpg">

      <p>Abe runs past a pair of binoculars. The help-text explains, that it can be
        used to survey the rest of the level and to shoot darts. As seen previously,
        these darts can be used to knock out Sligs. I'm not a hundred percent sure
        whether this is lethal or non-lethal, but personally I'm inclined to think
        it won't kill them.</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/door.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle">Since levels now have multiple levels of depth, doors were reimagined to be
        short-distance teleporters, that beam Abe from one place to another using
        lightning bolts.</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/mural.jpg" class="small">
      <p class="subtitle">A mural showing a Mudokon carrying a huge cog on his shoulders. This image is very similar to the titan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(mythology)">Atlas</a> from Greek-mythology.</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/gumrot.jpg" class="small">
      <p class="subtitle">Right after Abe leaves the teleporter-door, we see a familiar old poster
        advertising Gum Rot. The poster also has a Fuzzle on it, which likely means
        that they're still canon and perhaps even part of the game.</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/dripik.jpg" class="small">
      <p class="subtitle">Even through he's just a placeholder, you surely won't scroll any further
        without first cherishing General Dripik.</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/hardhat.jpg" class="small">
      <p class="subtitle">Mudokon in hardhat squatting.</p>

      <p>To visually convey Mudokons joining Abe, they now have little yellow
        hardhats, that they throw away, when Abe calls to them.</p>

      <p>The new Gamespeak appears to have two calls (there might be more, but
        this footage only showed two) a green call and a red one. The green is
        basically a combination of "All of you!" and "Follow me!", while the red one
        is "Wait!".</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/positive.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle">Positive Quarma forming around the freshly-freed Mudokon.</p>

      <p>Abe calls to the Mudokon and we can see a small yellow shine appear and fly
        into him. This is how Quarma is represented now. Later we'll see how negative
        Quarma looks like.</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/poss.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle">The screen visibly blurs as the orb leaves Abe and there
        is a noticeable color-shift.</p>

      <p>We then get to see possession. I have to say, my opinion about it is mixed.
        While the graphical effect beats miles on New 'n' Tasty's "Mandala", it's
        still far less iconic compared to Oddysee's and Exoddus' blue spirit balls. I
        especially dislike the possession orb, which looks way out of the place and
        when it possesses the unfortunate Slig, it doesn't even look like it's
        "invading the mind" or something, rather just makes a quick lap around it and
        it's done.</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/leave.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle">As the Slig gets unpossessed, the orb is once again
        controllable, albeit only for a very short time. As Lanning explained, it
        will be possible to "chain-possess" multiple Sligs.</p>

      <p>Possession is now time limited. I'm not sure whether I like this or not yet,
        so I'm reserving judgement. Also as the devs explained previously, you may
        have the choice to either gib or just knock out your target.</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/pistons.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle">Pistons serve as an environmental hazard in this puzzle. Jump at
        the wrong time and you're toast.</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/jelly.jpg" class="small">
      <p class="subtitle">Jelly.</p>

      <p>Abe picks up a "Royal Jelly". For those who might not know, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_jelly">Royal Jelly</a>
        in real life is a kind of substance bees and other hive-creatures feed to those
        larvae, who are destined to be queens. This causes changes in their bodies and
        makes reproduction possible. <br><br> However, as we can see here it just increases
        Abe's max health. Even so, I'm curious about the implications. As we know
        there is at least one Mudokon queen, Sam, who is held captive by the Vykkers
        and Glukkons. Maybe Abe is collecting this for her or to create a new
        queen?</p>

      <p>The player uses a jawbreaker enveloped in rubber bands to knock out a Slig,
        who's holding a lever, not letting him proceed. The non-lethal take down nets
        Abe one Quarma.</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/delivery.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle">Abe and his Muds board a "Content Delivery System", which lets them travel
        between layers of the map.</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/boxes.jpg" class="small">
      <p class="subtitle">Whack!</p>

      <p>As they arrive at the next layer, we can observe Abe breaking some boxes by
        striking them with his hands. Perhaps in a time of great need melee is an
        option too?</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/orb.jpg" class="small">
      <p class="subtitle">The new Security Orb design</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/gore.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle">Abe has just performed a 'gory' kill.</p>

      <p>Abe murders a Slig in cold blood by using possession, netting him a
        large sum of negative Quarma. This ain't Exoddus anymore, killing Sligs is
        now undesirable. Unless, of course, if you want to achieve the bad ending.</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/muds.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle">The gang's all here!</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/medium.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle">Uh-oh.</p>

      <p>Abe calls a large number of Mudokons to himself, who leave their workplaces.
        The alarm immediately goes to Medium, which means that the guard posts
        will start spewing out Sligs.</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/pop.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle">By throwing multiple "Fizzy PoPs" the player can destroy fragile floors and
        walls, without starting a fire. And it can also make for a stylish entrance.</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/rung.jpg" class="small">
      <p class="subtitle">"Oh, I wonder who this might be?"</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/rip.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle">"This was a terrible idea!"</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/negative.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle">Your actions have repercussions...</p>

      <p>A Slig gets possessed and by triggering the little bell above the guard post,
        another Slig is spawned, who is then perforated. This results in a huge hit of
        negative Quarma, which is represented by many black blotches flying into
        Abe.</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/reload.jpg" class="small">
      <p class="subtitle">Instead of being jerked back, Sligs now have to reload between firefights.</p>

      <p>Abe continues his rampage using the Slig, until he is dispatched. Afterwards
        he crafts a flamethrower, whose recipe has changed since EGX 2017.</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/flamethrower.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle">It's original recipe was a bottle of SoulStorm Brew + an extinguisher + a lighter.</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/flames.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle">You've done it now.</p>

      <p>With the flamethrower, he kills many Sligs. Amusingly, death by fire only
        gives Abe 7 negative Quarma.</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/bounce.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle">It is shown that you can ring guard post bells with Abe's throwables too, like
        jawbreakers.</p>

      <img src="imgs/ign/ouch.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle">Yeah, that's not gonna end well.</p>

      <p>In the final scene we see Abe and the Mudokons trying to avoid a train flying
        past them, however, they fail. But before we could see them being gibbed, the
        camera fades to show Lorne Lanning and the interviewer again.</p>
