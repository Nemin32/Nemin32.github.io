The Schism: A Quick Timeline

Pondering about the lore one may wonder, how did the whole slave-master
relationship happen between the Glukkons and the Mudokons? While it might seem
plausible, that this was "always the case" or that it's not known, the real
answer is far more interesting.

It is said, that eons ago (remember Oddworld, being ten times as big as Earth,
evolves far slower) the Mudokons and the Glukkons lived together in relative
harmony. They both practiced the same mysticism and nothing would have stopped
this peace, except that one day a Mudokon paw appeared on the moon orbiting
Oddworld.

For the Mudokons, this meant an absolute sign of supermacy. The paw was the sign
of the Gods, telling everyone, that they were the chosen species. But to the
Glukkons, this was an absolute disaster. Not wanting to endure this humiliation,
they decided to turn to Alchemy with the intentions to disprove the Mudokons'
claim. Then... something happened. It was never explained what it exactly was,
but Lanning described it as a "disaster", which nearly drove them to extinction. This
combined with their incapability to challenge the Mudokons' beliefs drove the
humiliated and grief-stricken Glukkons underground, who swore never to look at the
moon again.

Thus began the Age of Science. Throwing mysticism aside, the Glukkons instead
began experimenting and inventing. This made them very powerful compared to the
Mudokons, who still lived as tribal spiritualists. And because their old hate
never faded, the Glukkons had no problems exploiting and enslaving their old
friends.

It's quite a tragic story and since I first learned about it, I believe that you
can't really say that "Mudokons are Good" and "Glukkons are Evil", because the
canon is a lot more complex compared to that. Neither part was innocent in this
event,

However, there is a problem. The canon actually branches in two ways and one of
them make this whole event impossible. Lanning has once said, that they
originally intended that when Abe escaped from RuptureFarms, there would have
been a huge meteor shower, which would have slowly carved out the paw, while our
hero escaped. However, this would mean that until Abe escaped, the paw didn't
exist, which would consequently remove the reason for the Schism to happen.

Until this point, I mainly dealt with facts(1), but there is a bit of speculation, I'd
like to share. While it is mentioned, that the Glukkons gave up on mysticism,
this doesn't actually seem to be the whole truth(2), especially with the recent
promotional material of Soulstorm(3). Not only are there multiple pieces of
concept art(4,5) depicting Industrialist priests, but as the interview states
occultism shares a major part in giving the Glukkons such power and influence.

I believe what they worship is in fact money itself (or more specifically
Moolah). Their elite's beastly Greed manifests as an entity of immense power. In
the previous games Abe only fought relatively small fishes, neither Molluck, nor
the Glukkon triumvirate or the Brewmaster can be considered even relatively
powerful, so we haven't yet seen anything from when Glukkons - feeling
threatened by Abe's unstoppable march - stop using Sligs and instead call down
the wrath of their "god". 

The specifics of this is of course up to everyone's imagination, but if the
Mudokons can call down natural disaster - like the thunderstorm that destroyed
RuptureFarms -, them wouldn't it be fitting if the Glukkons had a nuke fuelled
by their greedy, vengeful god?

Q: So there?s Industrial occultism as well as the Native spiritualism?
