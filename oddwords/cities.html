    <h1>On the cities of the Industrialists</h1>
<p><b>DISCLAIMER:</b> What you read here is mostly speculation and aimless
headcanon, sprinkled with a few facts. The information referenced from
interviews are the closest we have to a greater Oddworld canon, so I handle them
as canon.</p>

<p>Ever since I got deeper into the vast Lore of Oddworld, I always wondered
about the daily life of the creatures, who inhabit this strange place. Since the
games never really touched on this subject, there is hardly any information
released on them, but using what little there is available, it's still fun to
speculate.</p>

<p>First things first, how do these cities look? Lanning describes these(1) as
vast underground cities that go deep into the planet's crust. The inhabitants,
who are described as "the parasites, fleas in suits and ties, tape-worms with
lapels" need a damp place to survive as - opposed to our planet Earth, - Oddworld is
a mostly dry planet.</p>

<p>I speculate that because of this, the entire city is upside down compared to
our standards. The lowly workers and other creatures - think non-slave Mudokons
and perhaps even Sligs - live in the top levels, where it's relatively dry and
hot, this place would be the closest to what we find normal. Because their eyes don't
work too well in natural lighting(2) below these surface dwelling creatures, -
where the Oddworld's star's light doesn't reach and only artificial light breaks
the eternal darkness - live the not-so-fortunate Glukkons and other small-time
business owners. And instead of having their offices in skyscrapers, the big
fish of the Oddworldian megacorporations have their offices as deep as they can
afford, where it's comfortably wet and dark, with every queen having her own
turf, which she fiercely defends. And even below them breathtakingly deep, dwell
the most influential creatures of the Industrialists, the Investors and major
Khanzumerz(3). These creatures have been described as gargantuan monstrosities,
who could easily wreck havoc, if they weren't appeased with the products the
Glukkons provided them.</p>

<p>Presumably similarly to how their factories work, these cities are littered
with vending machines for nearly everything one can imagine. And even if you
could avoid these taking all your Moolah, you are constantly bump into shady
beings trying to rip you off by offering questionable products at a "very good
price".  The streets are filled with cars and other vehicles, flying at
incredible speed.  Jaywalking almost always result in death, so few try.  In my
headcanon, a creature rarely leaves the level it's living on, as you can find
everything you want (and of course afford) there and going to a lower level
would increase the chances of you running into someone you'd find quite
unpleasant.</p>
 
<p>Since everything is corporationalized, crime on higher levels is be
prevalent, meaning the meeker, weaker or poorer inhabitants rarely step out of
their homes at night. The few who roam the streets in the late hours try their
best to mug whomever they can. On the lower levels, you can enjoy greater
safety, as long as you're not someone important. In a cutthroat world like
Oddworld, the heads of companies use heavily armored cars or when this is not
possible, employ a dozen bodyguards, who - for the right price - constantly
guard them whenever they need to step out their offices. On the lowest levels,
even the deadliest rivals put their differences aside and pull their necks in,
not to provoke the Khanzumerz and die a gruesome and quick death.</p>

<p>All in all, if I had to describe these cities with a metaphor, I'd say
they're similar to fruits, who from the outside look perfect, but inside they
rot and are infested with worms.</p>

  <i>"So we have these craters, and then out of these huge shells of collapsed
    earth that go down thousands of feet, they?ve built cities. When you?re
    looking across the landscape, you can see just the tips of cities coming out
  of these craters. But they?re not craters so much as large pockets."</i></p>

<i>"There are scenes in the film I want to do where Mullock, after he fucked up
  and he?s being taken to the boss and he passes his mom who says ?You blew it,?
  and he has to go down and meet the investors. They live underground; like how
  I said about how the world is separated. He takes an elevator ride down 1700
  storeys and a little midget guys picks you up as an escort, but as you go down
  and the temperature increases, they?re getting bigger and bigger, while the
  security guards from up above are dying and sweltering from the heat."</i></p>
