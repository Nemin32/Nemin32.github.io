    <h1>A few thoughts on Molluck</h1>

    <p><i>(The following essay is an amalgamation of canon lore, parts of the
      unreleased canon as explained to me by <a href =
        "http://www.oddworldforums.net/member.php?u=7322">kjjcarpenter</a> (one
      of the few - as I like to call them - "Lore-gurus", also known as people who extensively
      studied and memorized Oddworld's released and unreleased canon) and my
      personal thoughts on the character.  While I was striving to retell the
      lore here as accurately as possible, please don't take anything here that
    you don't absolutely know is canon as fact. Enjoy!)</i></p>

    <p>Today I'd like to talk a bit about the big bad, the "meanest boss in the world",
    the guy whose malicious intentions you don't need to be told about, Molluck the
    Glukkon.</p>

    <p class = "subtitle">An early concept art of Molluck and also one of the first times the Magog logo appears.</p>

    <p>Playing only Abe's Oddysee and Abe's Exoddus and not having cared about the
    intended storyline of Munch's Oddysee, one might think that he's really the top
    of the foodchain, hell maybe even the owner of the Magog Cartel. The truth is
    more complex than this and it might be surprising to some. Molluck is in fact
    the prodigal son of <a href = "trial.html">Lady Margaret</a>, the actual current owner of the cartel.  The
    Glukkon queen gave the task of running RuptureFarms (along with a few other factories,
    we'll get to that) as a test to Molluck to prove his worth before he gets an
    actually large turf.</p>

    <p>While you might think that RuptureFarms is the "biggest meat processing
    plant on Oddworld", it's not, Abe only says this, because he is so
    sheltered from the outside world. The number part in RF1029 is not a
    codeword, it's a serial number, meaning the factory has more than a
    thousand brethren. And while it might seem huge to us, Oddworld has ten
    times as much surface area as Earth so even a "smaller" factory like RF is,
    is multiple times larger than the largest ones on Earth. In fact, Mudos
    (the continent where all the currently released titles take place) is
    actually kind of a paralell to Africa, with backwater factories (like the
    ones we visit in Oddysee and Exoddus) that employ
    - and exploit - the less developed natives. This is why it is a huge shock
    to the cartel that a Mudokon-uprising could actually bring down a factory.
    It's about as believeable to the Investors and senior members like a group
    of tribals with spears and warpaint winning against a modern army.</p>

    <p>I mentioned other factories before so let's continue with that. This might not
    be such a surprise as it was pretty explicitly stated in Abe's Exoddus, but it
    won't hurt to point it out here too. Molluck is either CEO or at least a major
    shareholder of Bonewerkz, FeeCo and Slig Barracks. Remember the reaction of the
    three Glukkons, who discuss his disappearance. Dripik mentions that "[he]'s
    gonna be pissed" and that "[...] now Necrum Mines, if he ever comes back then
    [they]'re screwed" so it is obvious that he's a superior of them. Aslik also
    says that it's "[their] turn to take over". These combined with Aslik's role of
    being <i>Vice</i>-President strongly implies - at least to me - that Molluck didn't
    only run RuptureFarms, he was also their boss and the owner/shareholder of
    Necrum Mines too.</p>

    <p class="subtitle">...and its messy interior.</p>
    
    <p>He also owned a personal vault in RuptureFarms, which - as the pictures
    imply - contained some of his most treasured belongings, including a lot of
    Moolah. The painting hanging on the background was especially interesting
    to me, as it portrays a young Molluck standing sheepishly next to his
    always menacing mother, which is not exactly a side of him one can see a
    lot. Another thing I noticed was the chair, which is surprisingly similar
    to what you could find here on Earth. With Glukkon anatomy being so
    different, one can't help but wonder how would they even sit on a chair
    like this.</p>

    <p class = "subtitle">A piece of concept art from the cancelled Oddworld movie:
    Molluck observing some of the many hanging Mudokon cells, where the tired
    workers return to get as much rest as they possibly can.</p>
    
    <p>Even his name was a clever choice as it is a reference to <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch">Moloch</a>, the Biblical
    false god of child sacrifice. The children here of course being the
    offspring of Sam, the Mudokons. Despite this - and some might disagree - I
    don't think Molluck is such a clear-cut evil character as the games portray
    him. Before I discuss this, this is the best place to clear up something:
    Abe - especially because he was the employee of the month - and his friends
    were never endangered by this. The Glukkons are stupid, but not this
    stupid. The Mudokons used for the Pops would have been specifically bred
    for that reason. This of course doesn't make things better, but it's a very
    common misconception that I had too.</p> 

    <p>The slaughter of innocents is a brutal choice and I'm not trying to
    justify it, however, there weren't any better alternatives either.
    Remember, he had to satisfy not only his very demanding mother, but also
    the a vicious group of Investors. And as Abe tells us, the "profits were
    grim".  Quite likely if he hadn't made a choice like this, he and his
    colleagues would have ended up on the chopping block, with someone who's
    even crueller, but also more efficient taking over.</p>

    <p>I'd like to end this post with the short timeline of what happened to him after
    the end of Abe's Oddysee. As we seen in the canon good ending, the Mudokons
    conjure a mystical thunderstorm over RuptureFarms and struck the nearby Slig to
    death with a well aimed lightning bolt. The same fate follows Molluck, whose
    suit disintegrates, revealing his surprising anatomy. Except he doesn't die.
    Either with a huge amount of luck or the meddling of Oddworldian gods, he is
    merely knocked unconscious and branded by the electricity passing through his
    head. The storm causes the factory to erupt in flames, however, Molluck gets
    himself together before he burns alive and escapes by unknown means. The
    authorities raid the factory, but since they can't find his corpse he is declared
    wanted for causing a loss of profit to the cartel.</p>


    <p>The lore here becomes quite vague. Where, how and when this happens is not
    known, but one thing is sure: Molluck, despite his best intentions to hide, was
    finally captured and he was brought before his very angry mother, who has to
    answer to the investors for his son's mistakes. After a likely thunderous
    scolding by Margaret, Molluck is escorted to an elevator to meet and to try to
    explain himself before the investors. This is where the known lore ends about
    him, and thus his fate is left unknown.</p>
