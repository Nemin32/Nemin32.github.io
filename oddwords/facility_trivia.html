    <h1>Some pieces of trivia about the locations Abe visits</h1>

    <p class = "capitalized">On this page I share some of my thought about a handful of locations we visit in
    Abe's Exoddus. Sadly the game itself doesn't really do them justice, as we only
    see the end of them and this we hardly get to know what's their purpose or
    intricacies. The quoted parts - like usually - are from "The Art of Oddworld
    Inhabitants: The First 10 Years".</p>

    <h2>Necrum Mines:</h2>
    <img class="small" src="necrummines.png">
    <p>Unusually, this place has no head-Glukkon, the only owner mentioned is the
    mysterious "SoulStorm Mining Co.". However, I believe that either this company
    is owned by the Glukkon-trio of Dripik, Aslik and Phleg or just Phleg alone.
    The former is supported in an old article where it is said that Molluck
    entrusted this trio with running the Brewery, while he was forced to hide. The
    latter is just my own thinking: Since Phleg owns Bonewerkz, the place where bone
    powder is stored, it would make the most sense that he owns the place where the
    bones are "produced" too.</p>

    <p class="bookpage">[Page 104: Untitled, about BLIND MUDOKONS]</p>
    <p class="capitalized quoted"><i>"Adding insult to injury, blinded Mudokons are forced to dig the bones from
    their own ancestral buiral grounds. The Glukkons are so greedy that the Mudokons
    are forced to work without sight for fear that it would lower their productivity
    if they found out that they had been exploiting their own burial grounds. This
    concept was spurred from real-world historical accounts of using native people,
    whether willfully or unwittingly, to undermine and destroy the record and
    culture of their way of life. The skin of Blind Mudkons is paler than Abe's."</i></p>

    <h2>Necrum:</h2>
    <img class="small" src="necrum.png">
    <p>I always found it weird how when Abe escapes from the Mines he ends up in a
    jungle. After all, the introductory cutscene talks, how they have been
    travelling in a desert for the entire day and there is not a single tree in
    sight when Abe and his friends enter the bural grounds. This is where the
    Artbook comes handy as it has a paragraph detailing how the Necrum jungle is
    actually an oasis in the middle of a desert, defended by a sacrophagus like
    structure. The book also notes, that since the Glukkons have infiltrated the
    place, the oasis began dying and crumbling away, which I suspect is intended to
    be a metaphor for old cultures disappearing because of greed.</p>

    <p class="bookpage">[Page 116: NECRUM]</p>
    <p class="capitalized quoted"><i>"Necrum is the vast burial ground for many Mudokons. It is an oasis in the
    desert sorrounded and protected by a giant stone structure reminiscent of a
    sacrophagus. It served as sacred final resting place for Mudokons long before
    GLukkons and Sligs arrived to exploit its contents. As Necrum was desecrated by
    the Glukkons and the bones of the Mudokon ancestors were stolen to create
    SoulStorm Brew, life itself was drained from the once thriving oasis. The air
    became arid and hot with the encroaching desert on its walls. All that remains
    is decayed, crumbling rock and the sparse wilted remnant of a once healthy
    junge. Early design influences were Mayan architecture and some of the
    structures from the Paris catacombs. Later rock spires, reminiscent of bone or
    worm eaten wood, were added."</i></p>

    <p>It is quite interesting that it seems spirits are only able to manifest in
    Necrum, as the text states, that the Weirdos are missing those limbs whose bones
    are taken out of the oasis. Also, this text confirms that Fleeches are in fact
    indigenous creatures. It is said the Vykkers genetically engineered these
    creatures to be the perfect pets for Glukkons, but for a long time I interpreted
    this as that they actually made them from scratch.</p>

    <p class="bookpage">[The Art of Oddworld Inhabitants, Page 118: NECRUM SPIRITS]</p>
    <p class="capitalized quoted"><i>"The Three Weirdos are spirits that call upon Abe to stop the Glukkons. They are
    already missing limbs due to the removal of their bones from Necrum. They are
    covered in Mudokon ceremonial paint and headdresses. The headdresses are
    symbolic of the wildlife that lives on Oddworld. Made from natural tulle fiber
    and river ploshed gems the Paramite, Scrab and Fleech are all part of the
    ceremonial themes assigned to each of the Weirdos."</i></p>

    <h2>FeeCo Depot:</h2>
    <img class="small" src="feeco.png">
    <p>These are likely to be the most known information on this page, but FeeCo is
    actually a word-play on the word "fecal". Also there is a poster with the
    following text: "Uncle Aslik / Keeping the trains running on time". This is a
    reference to Mussolini, who was also said to be keeping the trains running on
    time.</p>

    <p>It is interesting that Aslik is mentioned to be FeeCo's Vice-President here. In
    other texts, like "I, Aslik", he is referred to as SoulStorm Brewery's VP.</p>

    <p class="bookpage">[Page 123: FEECO DEPOT]</p>
    <p class="capitalized quoted"><i>"Feeco Depot's name caused a chuckle when Inhabitants realized thatt it was
    possible to combine the word 'fee' and the word 'company' and create Feeco,
    which sounds remarkably similar to fecal. It was a triumphant moment in
    potty-humor history. Fitting that the vice president of Feeco Depot was named
    Aslik."</i></p>

    <h2>Slig Barracks:</h2>
    <img class="small" src="sligbarracks.png">
    <p>If you think about it, Dripik's role is never really explained in the whole
    Brew-deal. Sure he has Sligs, but as the excerpt states, they are never used for
    active military conflict. Phleg and Aslik basically fulfill all tasks necessary
    for excavating and processing bones, so our favorite buffon General really has
    no reason to be around. Through, I'm glad he was finally included, as this area
    was always my favorite in Abe's Exoddus, the aestethics of it were absolutely
    captivating and seeing those tents go as far as your eyes can see were a really
    enchanting sight for me when I was younger.</p>

    <p class="bookpage">[Page 135: SLIG BARRACKS]</p>
    <p class="capitalized quoted"><i>"The Slig Barracks has never once been used in a real military conflict, but has
    been built up by the cowardly and self-important General Dripik. The Barracks
    reflect his own need for power and have been built up for years in a haphazard
    way, temprorary structure piled atop temporary structure. Everything has an over
    the top military feel-utilitarian, stripped down with no subtlety whatsoever.
    The visual "feel" for the Slig Barracks is a cross between a WW1 trench
    encampment and the Berlin Wall. Sandbags, barbed wire, sharpeend poles, Slig
    Lockers, tents, all can be found here in the barracks."</i></p>

    <h2>Bonewerkz:</h2>
    <img class="small" src="bonewerkz.png">
    <p>This place is the main bone-powder storage facility. When I was a child I always
    wondered, why the Glukkons feel like they're out of the stuff, if it lies in
    huge heaps at the bottom of the facility. The Artbook has an answer to this:
    Those piles are actually just useless slag. You have to wonder how much bone was
    actually processed there that just the byproduct almost fills the bottom half of
    the facility.</p>

    <p class="bookpage">[Page 129: BONEWERKZ]</p>
    <p class="capitalized quoted"><i>"Once the Mudokon bones are harvested from Necrum, trains bring them to
    Bonewerkz, the main storage facility for bone powder used by SoulStorm Brewery.
    Brick columns support a massive hangar-like structure filled with slag heaps
    from bone powder."</i></p>
