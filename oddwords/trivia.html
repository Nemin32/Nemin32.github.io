    <h1>A few interesting things cut from the games</h1>

    <p class="capitalized">On this page I'm collecting interesting facts from the canon that I found, that don't really belong anywhere else. The texts between quotation marks and in Italics are directly quoted from Oddworld's first artbook, <i>The Art of Oddworld Inhabitants: The First 10 Years</i>.</p>

    <h2><u>Exoddus</u></h2>

    <h3>"Mudombies" (1):</h3> 

    <img src="mudombie.jpg">

    <p class="subtitle">Freaky!</p>
    
    <p>Abe's Exoddus would have originally featured zombified Mudokons, whom Abe would
    have needed to lead to their resting place. Presumably we would have
    encountered them in the jungles of Necrum or in the Vaults. My guess as for why
    they were cut is that presumably they wouldn't have been too different compared
    to 'normal' Mudokons and the disk space was scarce.</p>

    <p><i>"Mudombies are Mudokon Spirits who cannot rest because their beloved burial
    grounds of Necrum are being strip-mined by the Glukkons. In a nutshell, they are
    hulking, idiot, zombie Mudokons."</i></p> 

  <h3>Elum (2):</h3>

  <p>If you rescued all 300 Mudokons, Abe would have had the chance to venture back
    into the ruins of RuptureFarms to rescue the Elum and then they would have made
    a big escape from the still-smouldering facility.</p>

  <h3>Guardians:</h3>

    <img src="guardian.jpg">

    <p class="subtitle">Despite their ability, that orifice has a very unfortunate appearance.</p>
    
    <p>Not strictly cut, as they do appear in the final product, but their purpose is
    never explained in-game. The artbook writes about them the following:</p>

    <p><i>"Abe lands upon the remains of a Necrum guardian. Guardians are remnants of
    ancient protectors. Long before the Glukkons ever knew about Necrum, the
    guardians were its sentinels, protectors of the sacred place and the Mudokons
    buried there. When alive these guardians had the unique ability of spitting
    fiery globbers of vengeance from the orifice between their horns."</i></p>

    <h2><u>Munch's Oddysee</u></h2>

    <h3>Social status (3):</h3>
     
    <p>At one point in development, back when MO was still planned to be a much more
    grandious game, it was planned that each character you meet would have a
    certain social status, which you could manipulate. Lanning explains it through
    the example of a Slig:</p> 
    
    <p>Basically if you possess a Slig who is "nobody" (that is he has cheap
    equipment), no one will take him seriously and certain areas won't open up
    to you, until you manage to upgrade your possessed character's status. If
    you were to approach a group of Sligs and tell them to follow you, they
    would just laugh and tell you to sod off. But if you tried again, this time
    wearing the coolest gear a Slig can dream of, they would do anything for
    you without a word.</p>

    <p>Also characters would have spoken to each other differently. The GameSpeak would
    still have just one button for "Greetings", but your character would have said
    different things to different characters. The aforementioned Slig for example
    would have just simply yelled at a Mudokon when you pressed the button, but if
    you encountered a Glukkon, your Slig would have immediately became as polite as
    they possibly can. This entire feature was sadly cut from the game.</p>

    <h3>Lulu's original journey (3):</h3>

    <p>While the basic concept is mostly unchanged, Lulu was supposed to go
    through a much more exciting path to become a Glockstar. Munch and Abe
    would have had a lot more to directly do with him, unlike in the finished
    game where he is possessed once and that's it.</p> 
    
    <p>He would have been a lowly Pud (the 'rank' of the least successful
    Glukkons) in a small meat packing factory, where his boss, a Glukkon named
    Sask, would have threatened him that if he doesn't do his job and slaughter
    a few Scrabs for their meat, he would be fired.</p> 
    
    <p>From this point, it's your job to make the best of the situation. You
    could have either done it as you were asked and butcher the animals, which
    would have resulted in negative Quarma. Or you could have chosen a
    similarly brutal (albeit for some reason more positive) way of dealing with
    the problem and murder a bunch of unsuspecting Sligs who were having a
    picnic nearby for their meat. This way you would have also made some scrap
    metal which would have made Lulu's boss very happy.</p> 
    
    <p>By doing enough errands in Lulu's name, he would have quickly been
    promoted to the top and as a Glockstar, he would have gained access to
    Vykkers Labs and by exploiting him Abe and Munch could have got Sam (by the
    original plans, we would have met the Mudokon queen in this game) and the
    Gabbiar out safely.</p>

    <h3>"RTS" (4):</h3>

    <p>Another really ambitious idea was that Abe was supposed to be able to direct
    entire factories by possessing their leading Glukkons. This way you could have
    affected the Industrialists on a major scale. Also the terrain around you would
    have been dynamic and your choices could have changed them into becoming
    healthier or more polluted.</p>

    <h3>Abe and Munch's disfunctional partnership, Roid:</h3>

    <img src="roid.jpg">

    <p>One might notice that Munch and Abe become friends incredibly quickly and
    without any fanfare in Munch's Oddysee. Originally this would have been largely
    different.</p> 
    
    <p>One of the first designs of Munch was a tapeworm, that Abe regurgiated
    any time he needed him. This was quickly scrapped and replaced with
    something more akin to what we got in the final version, but it would have
    been lot less about the duo cooperating and more about Abe carrying Munch
    around on a wheelchair, with him having no word about where they should go.</p>
    
    <p>Also at one point it was planned that Munch, after all the experiments that
    had been done on him by the Vykkers, would have developed a kind of Mr.
    Hyde like personality, which would have manifested as a mindless, hulking,
    muscle-bound beast called Roid. And the 'best' part is to call upon this
    creature Abe would have had to punch and beat Munch until he went
    mental.</p>
