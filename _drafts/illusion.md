# The Illusion of Depth

I've been a fan since I was around six or eight years old. I've been an involved fan for about five
or six years now, ever since I joined around the time Soulstorm was announced. While I obviously
wouldn't claim that I've seen and read *everything* related to the series (the simple fact that MoM
has over six hundred interviews, many of which are just slight reiterations of previous interviews
alone means I could probably waste another few months reading those, not that I want to,) I can
safely say that I spent enough time learning about everything that's worth one's while about the
series.

There is much to like in the series, if there wasn't I wouldn't be here. The early games' charming
gloominess, the ethereal music, the endearingly stupid jokes, or the deeply stereotypical yet
massively amusing characters. However, if you were to talk to other fans, there is one more aspect
many like to bring up: The 'depth' of the series.

I think this is merely an illusion.

Let's take off our rose-tinted glasses and put on some ugly, objective shades.
