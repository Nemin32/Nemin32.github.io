# The Joy of Abe's Suffering
{:.no_toc}

I love Abe's Oddysee. Perhaps it's not exactly a unique sentiment, but nonetheless it's true. There
are very few if any games that come close to the joy Oddysee gives me. In this post I would like to
provide some introspection why this is and I hope that it might give a few of you a new angle of
appreciation for the game.

## Introduction

The year is 2006 or perhaps 2007... or maybe 2005, it's a blur really. I'm still in kindergarten and
my only experience with gaming is whatever my older cousins played on their PlayStation 1 and it
just so happens that Abe's Oddysee is one of these games. I was immediately captivated and also
creeped out by the dark atmosphere, "violent" deaths and menacing sounds of the game. To my 6-7
years old self Oddysee was horror, but not the kind of horror that makes you want to never look at
it again, rather the one that makes you wanna peek even though it scares you. Long story short, I
was in love with the game, despite the fact that until several years later I never even got farther
than the Monsaic Lines. It simply didn't matter, those three early areas cemented the game in my
mind.

Then came Exoddus and while I wouldn't say that my love for Oddysee was lost, I simply got way more
out of the former at the time because of things like QuikSave and since I played it on the PC, I
also had access to DDCheat and the level skip cheats. However, as the years passed and I rubbed
shoulders with more and more people from the fandom and also read far more about the circumstances
under which these games were made, I started to gain a newfound appreciation for Oddysee, that
finally made me reconsider about which game I consider my favorite.

## The First Impressions

![](/imgs/aorant/rf_outside.jpg)

> **Abe:** This... is RuptureFarms. They say it's the biggest meat-processing plant on Oddworld.

Even from the very first second you start the game, it is made clear to you, that Abe - and by
extension you, the player - are a speck in the machine, as the camera pans over the metal labyrinth
that is RuptureFarms. There is nothing welcoming about this place, everything is dilapidated, dirty
and oozes with a sense of uncaring coldness. No one would hear you scream if you died in this place,
nor would anyone care if they did. The feeling is reinforced by the ever-present Security Orbs which
survey both the outside of the facility and the workers inside, along with our first short sighting
of the Slig guards. Maybe your death means nothing, but it is obvious that your discontent would
swiftly be dealt with.

![](/imgs/aorant/rf_workers.jpg)

Then we arrive at the only unintentionally humorous part of the cutscene, the part where Mudokons
are pulling levers for absolutely no obvious reason. Perhaps the original intention was to be more
or less a metaphor, showing how little their work is worth, but sadly whether this was the case or
not, it just looks silly in hindsight. Still, such a mistake is minuscule compared to how great of a
moodsetter this intro is, so lets leave it at that.

![](/imgs/aorant/rf_chute.jpg)

Even the products this plant makes look disgusting. From the endless lines of carcasses and huge
circular saws, to the dirty barrels and the chutes whose method of filling them reminds one of
vomiting -- or worse, defecation; the crapsack nature of this world starts forming in the players
mind as they realize someone probably eats this stuff.

![](/imgs/aorant/protag_antag.jpg)

Finally we are introduced to our main protagonist and main antagonist. The game makes sure we
understand just how different these characters are just from how they are showcased. Abe is shown
hung up in a cell, on him only a loincloth as he's awaiting his punishment in distress. Molluck
quickly shows up on the screen, appearing almost gigantic as he condescendingly looks us down. From
this moment you start rooting for Abe and hope that whatever situation he's in won't be his end.

The game then takes a step back and changes gears for a second, introducing us to Abe's recent past,
his role in RuptureFarms and how he became an enemy of the establishment. Unlike some kick-ass
heroes of the time, Abe's no fighter, he isn't even an important figure, he is a janitor. A janitor,
who's at the worst place at the worst place possible.

> **G-Man, Half Life 2:** The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world.

After a quick reminiscing from Abe about the extinct Meeches and the other products RuptureFarms
still produces; we are shown a room full of creatures like Molluck and it is quickly obvious from
both Abe's narration and their grimaces that they are not happy. Indeed, they are rather scared as
the company is facing financial hardships. Every eye is on Molluck, who despite the tension does not
buckle and quickly convinces the board that everything is going to be fine if they go through with
his plan. This plan being the systemic genocide of the factory's Mudokon workforce. Abe who
accidentally eavesdropped on the meeting decides to abandon his post and try to save his
life. Moments later a camera descends from the ceiling, documenting the event and unleashing the
numerous security forces of RuptureFarms on him.

I hate to mention this, but for correctness' sake I kind of have to: as Abe is running away, a Slig
quickly appears behind him presumably to neutralize him. Yet, he never even tries using his weapon
that he wags almost like a tail as he's chasing Abe. I understand that OWI was probably in a tight
spot when designing this scene as they both had to make it tense enough, while also figuring out how
to give Abe a logical reason for surviving his initial disobedience, but still, this scene could
have been handled better.

## A Short Narrated Walkthrough of Oddysee

In this section I'll go through the game quickly, naming some important things players can figure
out just by playing the game, before diving into some more in-depth topics.

### *"Welcome to the House of Fun"* / RuptureFarms

Putting the bombastic intro behind us, we are finally thrust into the game. There is no ceremony, no
tutorial ,aside from a few scrolling LCD screens, but let's not compare those to actual
tutorials. We are simply told that we should run as enemies are sure to arrive quickly. The game
employs here a bit of scripting as we are actually in complete safety until Abe grabs the first
ledge and hoists himself up and even then the Slig is unable to reach us, unless one is foolish
enough to go back. We are steadily introduced to some of the basic gameplay elements of Oddysee:
Sligs shoot you on sight, bombs are deadly, Abe's no fighter, and so on. All of this is done in an
organic fashion and experienced players aren't forced to play "by the rules;" if you already know
that Abe is capable of possessing enemies, you can simply possess the Slig on the screen which is
supposed to teach you sneaking and then shoot the one sleeping next to the elevator.

Speaking of possession, it is an exemption to the organic tutorial described above. The game never
directly tells you about it until you reach the Monsaic Lines. Even the manual keeps a tight lip
about this. This is in fact a lucky byproduct of the game's [original
plot-progression](https://magogonthemarch.wordpress.com/2008-2/nathan-interviews-lorne-lanning/)
that ultimately didn't make the cut. Basically the idea was that since Abe's mouth is stitched shut,
he's not capable of either talking or chanting and thus only when he reached the native areas - and
lost his stitches - could he start retaliating, peacefully and otherwise.

![](/imgs/aorant/barrels.png)

Moving on, even if these areas are only here to teach you, the art does not take a backseat. We are
shown parts of the production line and just how wasteful RuptureFarms really is. There are tons upon
tons of barrels and yet they are supposedly losing profits? Nothing points these things out, the
player is expected to draw the conclusions themselves, which I consider a strong side of this
game. There is a certain wonder to realizing things, that simply isn't there if you're told.

After being given the chance the rescue your first Mudokons and have survived the encounters with
the somewhat lazy Sligs of Zulag 1; the player will reach the end of the line, however, their
triumph is short lived as you're unexpectedly slapped with one of the biggest sucker punches of the
game:

![](/imgs/aorant/workers_die.jpg)

I imagine most people are shocked upon reading this sign, albeit for very different reasons: some
because they didn't even bother to save Mudokons until now and the consequences of their lack of
actions suddenly manifested. Others might be shocked about the number, they tried to save everyone,
yet the numbers don't add up. This is of course due to secret areas, which are admittedly not easy
to spot unless you really pay attention. Though I suppose there will be those who simply won't care
despite the fact that the game isn't warning you as a joke.

### The Escape / Stockyards

So, you finally left that hellhole behind. Or so you thought, as it isn't Mother Nature who greets
you at the other end of Abe's comical escape. Before you can leave, you still have to dare the
outskirts of RuptureFarms, the Stockyards. This area uses the game's screen-based layout greatly. As
you move further and further away from the factory which is perpetually illuminated by sickly
lamp-light so does it dawn on you that it is in fact the middle of the night. This is a nice example
of subtle continuity, as in the intro Abe said that he "was working **one night** at RuptureFarms."

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/aorant/stockyards.png" description="Credits: <a href='https://vgmaps.com/Atlas/PSX/index.htm#OddworldAbesOddysee'>vgmaps.com</a>" %}

The level can be divided into two sections, one of which is where the influence of the factory is
still very strong. This is signaled by the presence of bright lights, floating mines, guard towers,
captive animals, and the general appearance of the platforms Abe is walking on. The other, far
longer section is where Abe moves in almost complete darkness and the only Industrialist influence
he encounters are Slig and Slog patrols and some mines.

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/aorant/lynched.jpg" description="Notice how the distant moon is contrasts the dark silhouettes of the dead Mudokons." %}

It easy to zone out and get lost in the beautifully painted night skies or lose focus due to being
chased around by enemies, however, the real elephant in the room shows itself once one pays more
attention to the environment. The silhouettes of lynched Mudokons are almost everywhere, underlining
the feeling of overwhelming odds and hopelessness Abe is facing against.

Still, he perseveres and finally encounters one of the most uplifting moments of the game, the
Mudokon Moon. As [revealed later by
Lanning](https://magogonthemarch.wordpress.com/oddworld-history/), this holy celestial body caused
the disagreement the at the time allied Mudokons and Glukkons, leading to the former's eventual
enslavement. However, Abe knows nothing of this, he just stands there, fascinated. That is until the
ground under him gives way and he falls...and dies. Yeah, in about one hour of gameplay we are
bombarded with experiences such as an oppressive and dangerous factory, trigger happy guards, the
moral weight of not saving your kin, seeing the lynched remains of said kin and now the main
character's death.

However, this isn't the time and place for Abe to die, so a new character enters to save the day,
BigFace. He is a mysterious shaman, who resurrects Abe and tasks him with completing two sacred
trials to receive a power strong enough to bring down RuptureFarms. I really like this. It presents
a pretty clear route Abe has to take, while leaving enough wiggle room to use this otherwise
simple plot to show us different areas of the world. I mean, both trials could have happened in one
of the areas easily, but that'd only be half the fun.

### Respite with Extras / The Monsaic Line

And so Abe given life again continues his journey into the heart of a remaining, albeit greatly
diminished, free Mudokon civilization. While I love the looks of this place, I have to admit, I
don't really understand how a place like this could exist. Mudokons reproduce similarly to bees,
meaning they are dependent on a queen to produce new offspring. Now from what we know, Mudokons have
long been in the servitude of the Glukkons and the only queen we know of is in captivity at an
unspecified Industrialist location. One has to wonder how did they even survive until now without
getting overrun by the Sligs and taken into the workforce. Sadly the game otherwise establishes
things very well, so it's impossible to not consider this a plot-hole. For instance, one could
stipulate that these are Mudokons who similarly to Abe also escaped RuptureFarms and returned to
nature. But this surely isn't the case as they are very aggressive against him and as the manual
says "they don't take kindly to city-folk." Similarly one could say that they simply survived as
long, but this is extremely unlikely as the average Mudokon lifespan is 45 years, much less than the
"eons" that the story about the Schism is talking about.

![](/imgs/aorant/monsaic.jpg)

Grumbling aside, the Monsaic Lines is a gorgeous area and a great momentary stop for a breath. This
area provides relatively few challenges aside from the initial "mini-trial" Abe has to complete to
be let into the more inner areas of the place. This is mostly in the form of slingshot-wielding
guardians, whose somewhat questionable way of authenticating others is to whistle a tune which the
other party has to mimic perfectly. Step too close and you'll soon find yourself with a pebble
between your eyes. Other obstacles include falling rocks, swarms of angry bees and the
oh-so-familiar bottomless pits.

This is where Abe/player is first taught to use possession against enemies. This is a huge
moment of empowerment as the Sligs who you could only outwit or perhaps sneakily take down using a
grenade suddenly become tools too that you can use and abuse for your own purposes.

Also this is where you're introduced to the Flintlocks which serve as sort of special "switches"
that you have to activate in later areas to proceed.

Once the player is equipped to face the dangers ahead, they are given a choice of how to
proceed. They're free to choose whether they want to dare Paramonia or Scrabania first, though once
they made their choice, there are no backsies. There is also a third "choice" albeit that one is
basically just going one screen further to see an envoy of Sligs patrolling the road back to
RuptureFarms. This is also a bit of environmental storytelling as it becomes obvious that even with
your magical powers, Abe alone isn't enough to surmount this blockade.
g
I'll first discuss Paramonia and then Scrabania as the wells leading to them come in that order.

### Rumble in the Jungle / Paramonia

![](/imgs/aorant/paramonia.png)

And so we arrive to one of my favorite locations of the game; the lush, green forests of
Paramonia. It is just such joy to experience this place, it's beautiful, full of great setpieces and
the framing of the Temple always looming in the background is simply superb. We are also almost
immediately treated to Elum, our trusty traveling companion.

Paramonia is really about spectacle as the area doesn't really provide any new gameplay features
(other than Elum of course), rather focuses on providing memorable moments. It also provides a
nice bit of foreshadowing as in one of the screens the player is treated to a several screens long
spiderweb, that implies what sort of enemies he's going to be facing against in the temple.

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/aorant/paramonia_temple.jpg" description="I am also a huge fan of those windmills you can see in the distance. Knowing that these areas are devoid of native Mudokons, they present an eerie reminder that there used to be a civilization here." %}

The whole area reaches its peak on its last screen, where we see Abe being nothing more than a tiny
ant in front of the door of the gigantic temple.

#### The Paramonian Temple

In stark contrast to the welcoming, bright forest, the temple is a cold, ancient structure which
immediately forebodes a change. The huge suspended stone tablet bearing the mark of the Paramite
further punctuates the feel that you're on someone's else's home court. And indeed, after you evaded
the Slig patrol that guards the entrances, you are introduced to a wholly new enemy that hasn't
appeared before, the Paramite. They are spider-like beings, whose face looks similar to hands. Their
gimmick is that alone they won't bother you until cornered, however, the moment two are on the same
platform, their anxiety evaporates and they immediately attempt to turn you into a snack.

This is where the Flintlocks come up again as you have to complete several smaller puzzles to
proceed to a final trial. This sort of layout is called a "Hub" in the community and there are
several of these in the game. I'll talk about them in more detail later, for now just keep them in mind.

It is interesting to note that this temple contains two gameplay features that don't appear anywhere
else in the game: swinging rocks that can kill Abe if he jumps at the wrong time and an Indiana
Jones-esque rolling boulder that you have to run away from.

### Scrabania

Unlike Paramonia, which is a lush forest, Scrabania is a sweltering desert, full of sand, huge rocks
and cacti. Elum joins us once more on the journey to the temple, as the duo dares the bomb-ridden
desert. Interestingly Slig patrols are far rarer in this area, their place taken by floating
mines. Perhaps the design intention behind this is the fact that Sligs are bog-dwelling creatures
and thus they can't tolerate the heat. The game never details this, so this is just me seeing things
into where there might not even be anything.

This area also features the so-called bladders. These are inflated balloons of animal-bladders
hanged onto poles with what appears to be antennas sticking out of them. The game never acknowledges
them, but it is pretty obviously part of ancient Mudokon tech, (the artbooks further give this credit.)

#### The Scrabanian Temple

After a stressful and narrow escape from Slogs, you finally arrive to the nesting place of
Scrabs. These are quadrupedal carnivores with surprisingly Mudokon-like chests. Similarly to the
Paramonian Temple, this area too presents you with an intro section and then later a hub, then
finally culminates in one long trial.

This temple is less about introducing new mechanics as it rather tests your abilities to abuse the
Scrabs' hyper-territorial behavior. Still it's a nice area and definitely just as challenging as the
other.

### Free-Fire Zone

So, you just completed two huge treks and received the magical tattoos. It's time to put the power
you got to use...on that unfortunate Slig patrol that doesn't even suspect what's going to hit
them. The Shrykull is a brilliant moment of empowerment for the player, as you're both invulnerable
and all-destructing at the same time. The fact that you only receive this power extremely rarely
further helps make these moments memorable.

Things have changed since you left in the Stockyards and the area surrounding it. The place is
filled with landmines and bloodthirsty Slogs. This doesn't only serve as a natural way of increasing
the difficulty as the game progresses, but also as a piece of environmental storytelling, showing
how Molluck really can't afford to have a rogue agent like Abe on the loose.

You of course can't return to RuptureFarms on the way you left, but luckily someone just so happened
to leave a bird portal in the right place...

### RuptureFarms - Zulag 1

We're back in the factory at last! Things are quite similar, however, there are more Sligs around
this time and also there is a wholly new batch of Mudokons to save. I didn't realize this when I
first finished the game, so I completely missed them, even though you can save quite many of your
peers by being a bit perceptive.

Once you feel like you're done, you can take the ballcar and leave for Zulag 2.

### The Boardroom

Molluck's not happy about Abe's progress as he's practically breathing down his and his board's
necks. Figuring RuptureFarms is a lost ship, he orders the complete gassing of the entire area,
intending to kill off every Mudokon left in the facility, including Abe. The Boardroom is a short,
nerve-wrecking gauntlet of rescuing a single Mudokon to in turn receive the power of the Shrykull
one last time. Despite the fact that there is a time limit, it's not really there to really screw
you over, it's more or less just a ploy along with the blaring sirens and flashing lights to try to
get the player riled up and cause them to make mistakes.

But once you successfully faced the challenge, you are presented with an extremely satisfying ending
as you fry the Glukkon directors and shut down the gas...only to be promptly knocked out.

The story loops back into itself and Abe is right back in his cell, having finished his tale. Now it
falls on the player whether Abe is rescued by the BigFace or is left to die in the hands of one very
angry Glukkon.

## Gameplay Mechanics

Now that we are up to speed, we can finally focus on the most obvious part of the game, the
gameplay. It serves as one of the three columns that makes Abe's Oddysee great. A lot of these can
be thanked to Paul O'Connor, one of the major game designers working on Oddysee.

### Movement

Grid-based movement isn't exactly a novel concept, but it is nonetheless a great way of making
things more predictable in chaotic situations. The distances Abe can hop, jump and survive falling
eventually become a sort of muscle-memory as you progress through the game, which lets you abstract
away the the scenery and focus on the puzzles as pure logical riddles.

On the other hand, sadly the system isn't perfect. The game is a bit iffy about how many inputs it
is willing to accept at once, so it happened to me multiple times that the game simply forgot that I
pressed a key in the heat of the action and Abe just fell to his death or ran right into the
enemy. Deaths like this are frustrating and can easily cause a loss of enjoyment for the player.

### Empowerment / Disempowerment

A very prevalent part of the gameplay is the repeated switches between giving power to the player
and taking it away from them. Abe is no fighter and he dies in one hit, so by default the player is
severely disempowered and has to rely on their stealth to get by. This is then broken by moments of
power, where the tables are turned and the player becomes the one to dish out some long-awaited
revenge.

#### Throwables

It might sound funny at face value, but the items Abe can pick up is one of the most basic examples
of empowerment utilized by the game. Rocks let him set off bombs, meat can be used to distract
enemies and grenades provide a weapon to a character that doesn't wield guns. It also plays into the
whole idea that Abe is just some lowly janitor, who has to use whatever means necessary to even the
absolutely brutal odds.

#### Possession

Possession is empowerment in two ways: obviously it gives a weapon to the player who is almost
defenseless otherwise, but it also gives them a "second life" as getting your Slig killed is not a
game-over (except in some sections where it is mandatory to keep your Slig alive or else you simply
can't complete the puzzle.)

Also, by possessing Sligs, you also gain the ability to command some of the Slogs, turning one of
the most vicious enemies Abe has to face into a satisfying tool to murder other Sligs.

#### The Shrykull

![](/imgs/aorant/shrykull.jpg)

I believe the Shrykull practically speaks for itself as for why it's a tool of empowerment. Both in
gameplay (as Abe becomes invincible and capable of destroying every enemy) and in the story (being a
Mudokon demigod whose power is only granted to the worthiest) the Shrykull is presented as the
ultimate power-fantasy.

Because of this the game has to be prudent enough with giving the player a tool this strong as a
very important part of empowerment is that it is relative. If Abe could turn into the Shrykull
anytime then all tension of the game would suddenly be lost, because you'd just obliterate all the
levels...and promptly forget about the game probably.

### GameSpeak

GameSpeak is honestly nothing jaw-dropping. It's a nice system sure, but talking to other characters
is basically a norm in video-games; so it being given a fancy name is pretty much just a marketing
thing. Sadly on the PC version of the game (this doesn't happen on the PSX as far as I know), you
need to hold down the button to talk all the way. This peculiarity caused many people to have
immediate bad impressions about the game and I can't entirely blame them. It feels awkward and
unintuitive.

Still, the system serves it's purpose well and there isn't really any voice lines that don't have
their proper purpose.

## The Sound Design

The sound design serves as the second column of the three columns that creates the uniqueness of
this game. From the atmospheric musics of each area, to the noises the characters make everything
feels unique and crisp and powerful.

### Sound Effects

An example I simply can't leave without mention is the possession sound. It is hands down the single
best video game sound effect that I know of. It is a perfect little story in itself: it starts out
modestly as Abe starts chanting, then the sounds starts swelling as the music cooperates with the
graphics until finally the crescendo peaks and the whole thing is punctuated further with a moment
of silence. It is almost like an exclamation mark at the end of a sentence and it practically
screams: the gameplay has changed, Abe is now in control.

### Character Voices

As for what the characters say, if there is one thing no one could dispute about Lorne Lanning, it's
that he's an excellent voice actor. Fans of the series all around the world know the famous
*"Hi. Hello. Follow me. Okay."* mantra by heart.

The voices also greatly help to emphasize qualities of the characters. The shrill, authoritarian
voice of the Sligs reinforces their role as corporate bullies. The unassumingly innocent voice of
Mudokons underlines their naivety.

### Music

The music is one I've got sort of a controversial opinion about: while I absolutely believe it fits
the game and serves its purpose well, I don't think it is good enough to stand on its own legs. Once
you take the music out of the game, the repetitiveness that you never otherwise notice due to all
the myriad of other noises the game makes suddenly becomes obvious. I've spoken with people who said
they like to listen to the OST outside the game, but I frankly couldn't really bear to do it when I
tried myself.

Putting this aside, I love how the game uses leitmotifs. "Slig Action" an obvious example that comes
to mind as a leitmotif that doesn't exist as an individual piece of music, rather it is a techno
beat that gets layered over the basic theme of the level thus implying that the Industrialists are
basically intruding and overshadowing everything they touch.

## The Art

I strive to keep this site mostly clean from swears, not because I shun them or anything, but
because I find them undignified for the topics I talk about, yet here I can't avoid it: Oddysee's
art is fucking amazing! I mean, seriously, look at that art! Sure it might be sort of pixelated due
to its age, but if you look past that veil and into what's actually being conveyed; you can't help
but be pulled into a living, breathing world, full of organic and logical - if exaggerated - objects.

This is of course due to the methods and principles OWI used to create the game's looks. There is a
set of rules that the fanbase sometimes refers to as the ALIVE principles, which dictated what each
screen in the game must look like. These can be read below:

> **[Paul
>  O'Connor](https://web.archive.org/web/19990221091824/http://www.videogames.com/features/universal/abe_dd/110298/index.html):**
>  All images must:
>* Be realistic.
>* Have solidity.
>* Be original.
>* Be cool.
>* Evoke emotion.
>* Look ALIVE!

Upon cursory glance these rules might sound somewhat vague, but they lay down some very important
requirements. Realism for instance, practically everything in the game makes sense and with some
suspension of disbelief could be imagined to exist in our world. Similarly solidity is one that
catches my attention, you practically feel the weight of the boulders and trees around you.

I'd like to mention three names whom are in large part responsible for the amazing visuals we see in
the game: Steven Olds, Farzad Varahramyan and Raymond Swanland.

Olds was responsible for creating most of the characters we know and love. He had a huge hand in
creating Abe's design, along with planning out other memorable characters like Sligs, Glukkons,
etc. Varahramyan was part of the Production Design team, his job was in-part to keep everything
consistent and fitting to the world. However, he also created creature designs, one of his
contributions being the design of Munch. Finally Swanland was responsible for the art of the world,
the matte paintings and large scope images of locations are all done by him. It's safe to say that
these three men had a huge impact on what Oddworld became and their names should be etched in every
fan's memory.

### Mudokon culture

As it becomes obvious from the story the Mudokons weren't always slaves, rather they used to be
pretty powerful species, capable of building magnificent structures along with devices, like the
bladders, that one can't even really guess the usage of. I felt like this is worth pointing out as
the locations would have looked great without them and yet they went that extra mile to convey a bit
of history without words.

### Technique

So what makes these screens appear so life-like? Well, it turns out they are actually paintings that
have been digitalized and the further drawn over by artists to give everything a realistic and
consistent look. This allowed artists to create environments that 3D models couldn't have replicated
at the time and also let them use the several boons conventional art brings to the table. Examples
include the gradient in the Stockyards escape and the decals (like blood-splatters, moss, etc.) that
fit realistically on objects.

## The Level Design

This section is strictly about how the levels work, not what they look like. Oddysee's levels can
more or less be divided into two general layouts, "Corridors" and "Hubs."

### "Corridors"

These are levels like the very first one, basically one long line of rooms, usually featuring some
setpieces (the Grinding Area in RuptureFarms, the Elum-run in Paramonia or the final trials in both
temples). These are mostly longer areas, sometimes spanning over multiple loading screens and
usually appear in the beginning or at the very end of chapters. They are great at breaking up the
Hubs' monotony, while also test the player to be able to complete larger sections of the game
without checkpoints.

### "Hubs"

Hubs are levels where there is one main screen where you can choose from several shorter challenges,
each of which you have to complete before you can move on. The most prominent examples of these are
in the temples and the Zulags of RuptureFarms. They serve as walls in front of the player's
progress, who has to spend quite some time to finish every mini-challenge. On the other hand, due to
the shortness of these sub-levels, failure is less punishing and players are free to choose some
any other sub-level if they feel frustrated. This is further encouraged by the maps that clearly
display how many Mudokons does each sub-level have and also their general layout. AO is strict
enough not to let you pass without first proving yourself, however, it is also kind enough to give
you the tools to let you progress at your own pace.

Every hub features special switches (flintlocks in the Native areas, door release levers in
RuptureFarms) that present a tangible way of conveying progress to the player. There is not much
fanfare to entering a level, trudging through, then leaving on the end; so putting in a special
level provides at least some ceremony to the whole ordeal.

### Level Features

Here I'll discuss some objects that you can find on levels.

#### Boom Machines

Gameplay-wise I have no problem with these as they present a pretty clear and clean way of
empowering the player as discussed above. However, in-universe they hardly make any sense. I get
that RuptureFarms is a very dangerous workplace, but that is due to the ruthless Sligs and the
machines that'd make any OSHA agent cry. Why is the place littered with free-to-take explosives?
It's practically screaming for workers to use it to rebel.

#### Sligs

Sligs are extremely versatile tools in terms of level design. They're enemies, tools and
environmental storytelling in one nicely-knit package. Their presence alone can easily make a less
experienced player uneasy as unlike in later installations, AO's Sligs shoot immediately and never
miss. The whirring of their mechanical pants also provide to the atmosphere, giving them a both
menacing and unnatural aura.

## The Story

As you might have noticed I didn't include the story into the three pillars that make AO
great. Before you close the page in anger, please let me explain myself. I appreciate AO's story for
what it is, but I don't find it part of its strongest suits. It is a simple but sweet story, easy
trumped by plenty of moderately famous books and even other videogames. The characters too aren't
particularly deep; they're basically the equivalents of folk tale characters. Abe goes through the
[Hero's Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey), more or less
point-by-point. Molluck too is almost satirically evil, plus he basically doesn't really appear
until the very end of the story. He's an effective villain, but he's not really a fleshed out
character. Which is somewhat understandable, knowing how he was supposed come back in Munch's
Oddysee, but still.

However, here comes the major "but" of this section. Perhaps the story and characters aren't the
best of the best, but the implied world is one of the best I've experienced in gaming. What I mean
by "implied world" is things that aren't mentioned in-game, but rather left open as things that the
player can ponder about. For instance, how did the Mudokons fall from a species that can build
megastructures like the Paramonian and Scrabanian temples to a dumb cattle-race of slaves. Or how
the societies work? Or if RuptureFarms is only a factory, how does the rest of the "civilized" world
look like?

This, however, is a double-edged sword. While it is true that leaving just enough things vague to
make the world more mysterious is an art on its own; one can nonetheless really easily fall into the
trap of attributing their own creativity as something that was "always intended as such." What I
mean by this is that I've spoken with many people who talk about how great this and that in Oddworld
is and then use their own head-canon as evidence.

## The William Anderson Controversy

> **William Anderson:** Lorne started telling people I never worked for his company and to this date doesn’t list me on the credits for the game.

Sadly even a game as great as AO has its darker side. William Anderson was a game designer employed
by OWI to create the basic systems of the game along with some level designs. He was never credited
for his work and to this day OWI refuses to recognize him for his work. Instead of paraphrasing or
copy pasting, I'll leave a link to the story
[here](https://magogonthemarch.wordpress.com/2019/03/11/mom-interview-william-anderson/). It is a
story worth knowing as it's one of the major blemishes on OWI's image.

## Conclusion

Is Abe's Oddysee a perfect game? No, obviously not. It has several shortcomings, some even quite
severe and still, to date I think it is the most distilled version of the Oddworld-experience that
none of the later games could capture quite as well.
