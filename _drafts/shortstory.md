# The Fly and the Worm

Deep below the surface, inside one of the many damp, dripping tunnels
connecting one city to another, a fly and a worm bumped into each
other. Through, to be entirely fair, it was only the Fly who did the
bumping part, as the Worm was entirely preoccupied with jamming its
head deep into a bucket of stinking, sickly red meat, not unlike the
color of its own slightly undulating body. The enormous bucket was
held between the Worm's two flimsy arms, which looked comically small
compared to the gigantic size of the being, whose several meters thick
body filled a good chunk of the tunnel as far as the eye could see.

The Worm pulled its head out of the bucket with some difficulty,
resulting in a wet 'pop' sound, then looked at the Fly with its small,
beady eyes. They stood there in silence for a moment or two before the
worm opened its foul smelling mouth and spoke in an entirely
emotionless, yet somehow still questioning tone:

"What?"
{:.dialogue}

The Fly shuddered at the sudden sound, dropping a small, haphazardly
drawn map of the complex tunnel-system of the underground. Its many
large mammalian eyes, which were busy reading the aforementioned map
just seconds ago, were now anxiously looking for the source of the
sound before settling on the dirty being who called out to it.

"I am terribly sorry for the intrusion, sir. I am absolutely at fault
here for not avoiding your..." - it stammered for a second looking
over the huge, bloated body of the Worm - "your generousness. You see,
I was very focused on this map."
{:.dialogue}
  
The Worm looked unfazed, the Fly was unsure whether because it bought
the false compliment or perhaps because it did not even notice its
barely avoided impoliteness. The Worm let out its enormous tongue and
licked the dripping sauce off of its chin before signaling its
acknowledgement with a grunt.

The Fly was a bit annoyed over the other's manners, but decided not to
mention it, since they were the offending party. Rather it asked the
following:

"Since my clumsiness has already disturbed you, for which I am once
again incredibly sorry, could the sir please answer a question? Is
this Tunnel 3? I have spent most of today's morning looking for it,
but I got so lost, I have decided in desperation to just take a
gamble and follow whichever path seemed most likely."
{:.dialogue}

"Mm. No, it's not. Now leave me alone."
{:.dialogue}

The Fly was about to just give up and move on, but then it
reconsidered. As a descendant of an important trader family, its pride
triumphed over its modest upbringing. After all it showed utmost
politeness while this... nobody... this... beast handled him with
utmost disrespect. This was offense not even such a gentle soul as
them could endure.

Of course there was a problem. Being only around two meters tall and
much more fragile than the Worm, a direct confrontation would only end
in a tragedy for the Fly. Its newfound nemesis could easily unburden
it's face from half, if not all of its eyes in a singular chomp. 

So instead the Fly decided to try scaring this red menace by mentioning
something it would have originally been too polite and meek to point out.

"I am very-very sorry, but there is one more thing I would like to
ask from the sir. May I please look at the container of the delicacy
you're consuming?"
{:.dialogue}
  
The Worm let out a long, exasperated sigh, then shrugged and slightly
turned towards the Fly, awkwardly holding up the bucket, so the other
could read it. The Fly focused really hard to read the label as it was
soaked in sauce and the tunnel itself was quite dim too. It took
several passes of its many eyes to finally make out the text, but it
was quite satisfied when it finally deciphered it.

"*'GutCo: Mystery meat, Ready to eat'*, eh?" it smugly asked.
{:.dialogue}

The Worm now visibly irritated replied with:

"Yes. Is that all?"
{:.dialogue}

"Well... Not entirely, have you not felt anything wrong with your
body nowadays?" the Fly asked with the same, almost condescending
tone.
{:.dialogue}
  
The Worm stared with a puzzled expression at the Fly, who feeling that
the moment is about to be ruined, quickly continued with:

"Because it turns out, I just flew by a GutCo facility on my way
here. Built into your side. Dear sir, you are eating yourself. Does
this not unnerve you?"
{:.dialogue}
  
The Worm was silent for a second and the Fly silently celebrated its
victory. However, the Worm suddenly threw its head back and let out a
terrible laugh.
  
"Ha! Well, I sure taste delicious!" the Worm bellowed, before pushing
its head back in the bucket.
{:.dialogue}
  
The Fly was speechless. 

"How could a being be so simple to not even care about something like
this?" it thought, while it's proboscis was frothing from
frustration.
{:.dialogue}

As there was no sign that the Worm will reemerge any time soon, the
Fly let out something akin a sigh, turned around and left, leaving the
other to continue its blissful self-cannibalization.
