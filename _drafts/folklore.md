# Folk-Lore

In the Oddworld community, there are a few fabled words, that cause a lot of
people's eyes to flame up, along with eliciting responses like "Oh man, it
would've been GREAT!" But just how much truth is these projects anyway? And I
don't mean their sales pitches, we all know those stories, they are basically
the reason this post got written. 

My question is, do we have any actual confirmation that these projects had any
chance of really happening?

The biggest culprit in not letting these ideas die in peace and instead being
turned into macabre zombies, existing as nothing more than hollow promises is
of course the previous marketing team of OWI, who more or less never decided to
make a stand and say "it won't happen", rather always kept the door open,
saying that it's still on the menu or that "production will start again soon"
even when it was obviously out of their capabilities to make these projects a
reality. This uncertainty eventually molded the community's general views into
a quasi-"pantheon" of projects OWI probably haven't considered for at least a
decade, but people still expect they'll eventually make.

In this post I would like to walk through a few of the most famous examples.

## SligStorm

The example of SligStorm is one of the best examples of this phenomenon.
SligStorm was confirmedly (see Wil's post below) just an idea, something fun
OWI thought up, but never really put resources into. However because of the
unfortunate way it was communicated, it slowly became part of the "Oddworld
Pantheon", a legend that turned a simple game idea into this heavily mystified
project, much greater in scope than it was ever intended to be.

The entire premise of SligStorm's story.

Interestingly the myth of SligStorm still happening was heavily perpetuated by
the fandom, with the Oddworld Fandom wiki stating for a long time that SligStorm
is an "upcoming game."


## The Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot

SligStom isn't a singular example. Maybe the most sought after game is "The
Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot", which was a game, that was supposed to run on
Stranger's Wrath's engine. Not only is the information behind it extremely vague
— Is it part of Oddworld? Or not? Both were said before. —, it also turns out
that development ended after just one month of pre-production and everyone who
was at the time capable of turning the project into reality was let go.

>I've heard nothing... I did hear about Fangus when I was leaving. That was

> **David Fried:**
>As far as Fangus, I don't... remember much.  I didn't see anything that they

>everyone was let go.

Despite this, a comment from Alf still kept the hopes up, so people still expect
to eventually see it made:

 > **Alf [Dear Alf; August 2011, Volume 2]:** The Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot
 > was simply the project we were working on when we stopped all internal game
 > development back in 2005. There was nothing wrong with it, production was
 > going well thanks to the robustness of the Stranger Engine. We’ve still got
 > all that development on disc, so we might return to it one day. 

## The Hand of Odd

Still there is more, like the Hand of Odd, a planned free-to-play Real Time
Strategy game, where you could either play as the Industrialists or the Natives,
on large scale battlefields, with each battle affecting the world somewhat.

>**Alf [Dear Alf 1]:** Hand of Odd is about us using the technology of Munch,
>enhancing upon it, and bringing it into the multiplayer world of gaming. How
>many players will be able to interact at one time is still yet to be

One of the two pitches of HoO in the very first Dear Alf. It's pretty modest and
seems to imply a traditional room-based RTS experience.
{:.subtitle}

>**Alf [Dear Alf 1]:** Think eco-extremists versus corporate greed. It's Exxon

The second pitch, found not much after the first, which promises things hardly
achievable even with today's technology.
{:.subtitle}

Despite these bold claims, it appears things didn't exactly go as planned as Alf
soon turned to damage-control mode and explained that, no, HoO isn't in fact
coming anytime soon:

> **Alf:** Hand of Odd is not yet.

> **Alf:** Hand on Odd. Heeheeeheee! No. There are rumors about Hand of Odd, but
> we're not working on that right now.

> **Alf:** Neeeooowwwellluhahhaaaaaauhm, we're not even in production for OHOO.

> **Alf:** Hand of Odd is still not on the production schedule.

Things however changed in 2011:

> **Alf [Dear Alf; August 2011, Volume 1]:** Oddworld: The Hand of Odd will be
> delivering next year. 

> **Alf: [Dear Alf; August 2011, Volume 2]:** Hand of Odd fell off our radar as
> production on Munch progressed. It was a tortuous and torturous labor for so
> many reasons, and we ended up in a position where the only way to deliver a
> completed game was with an engine that couldn’t possibly power what we wanted
> Hand of Odd to be. There was just no sense in returning to it at the time. But
> as you should know, it’s re-entering production soon.

Interestingly, just a few months before, in February, 2011, Alf said the
following:

> **Alf [Dear Alf; February, 2011]:** Ideas never go to waste here at Oddworld,
> and Hand of Odd is still among the concepts rattling around. The games
> industry is very different to what it was a decade ago, and our eventual plans
> for Hand of Odd will probably differ accordingly, but for now it’s not
> something we’re building. 

The fact that Lorne Laninng was so eager to drop the project after his quick
chat in the loo with Robert Kotick, seems to imply that HoO was in fact not
ready to be "delivered next year."

The game didn't come up again, except one time where Alf had the following to
say about whether HoO is coming that year or not:

> **Alf:** Nope! Hand of Odd is an ambitious project, and it will take long
> enough just to decide what exactly we want from it. 

## Conclusion

The list doesn't end here of course. One could still talk of Wage Wars, Citizen Siege, Fearytales and the rest. The point is that the trend is quite obvious:

- OWI announces something
- They promise heaven and hell
- Something happens, which causes the project to never come to fruition
- OWI is unable or unwilling to temper expectations instead resorting to "Hey, we
  might do it later."
