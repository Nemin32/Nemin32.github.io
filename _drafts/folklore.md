# Folk-Lore

In the Oddworld community, there are a few fabled words, that make a lot of
people's eyes flame up, along with words like "Oh man, it would've been GREAT!",
even though a lot of these people probably have no idea what exactly it is they
are asking for.

I mean... What *are* these projects? And I don't mean their sales pitches, do we
have any actual confirmation that these projects had any chance of really
happening?

The biggest culprit is of course the clumsy and careless communication from
OWI's part, who first hyped the community up by announcing projects early before
even knowing whether these projects will come to fruition or not. However, of
course the community itself plays a part in it for still perpetuating the same
myths and half-truths from close to two decades ago, after these were debunked.

In this post I would like to walk through a few of the most well known examples.

## SligStorm

The example of SligStorm is one of the best examples of this phenomenon.
SligStorm was confirmedly just an idea, something fun OWI thought up, but
because of unfortunate communication, it slowly became part of the "Oddworld
Pantheon", a legend that turned a simple game idea into this heavily mystified
project, much greater in scope than it was ever intended to be.

The entire premise of SligStorm's story.

## The Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot

But it isn't a singular example. Maybe the most sought after game is "The Brutal
Ballad of Fangus Klot", which was a game supposed to run on Stranger's Wrath's
engine. Not only is the information behind it extremely vague — Is it part of
Oddworld? Or not? Both were said before. —, it also turns out that development
ended after just one month of pre-production and everyone who was at the time
capable of turning the project into reality was let go.

And despite these more or less concrete signs that the project is long dead,
people still vehemently ask for it.

## The Hand of Odd

Similarly another project still going rounds is Hand of Odd, a planned
free-to-play Real Time Strategy game, where you could either play as the
Industrialists or the Natives, on large scale battlefields, with each battle
affecting the world somewhat. While it might sound cynical, when one takes off
their rose-tinted glasses, it becomes apparent, that these are buzzwords. The
fact that Lorne Laninng was so eager to drop the project after his quick chat in
the loo with Robert Kotick, seems to imply that HoO was in fact not ready to be
"delivered next year."
