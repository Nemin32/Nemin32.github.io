* My thoughts about the Oddwall

As the first Oddwall is nearing it's completion, I wanted to talk a bit about my
own thoughts and expectations related to the picture we got and it's effects on
the follower numbers.

** HOW?

But first, let me explain the methods I used to record the data I'm basing my
observations on.

Since I was curious about how the Oddwall would affect subscriber counts, I
started recording the subscribers of Facebook, Twitter and Youtube four days
before the actual event started. This let me establish a baseline for subscriber
tendencies (losing or gaining them and how quick this happened) and I also
recorded how many likes each page had at the beginning.

** YT

Let's start with the good: The Youtube has been growing quite nicely.

The 300 subscriber requirement was reasonably set and it was met within two
days. Sadly, however, the growth has completely declined, only bringing in
around 15 people a day. When I started recording the statistics, it had 17189
and at the time this was written, it had 17632 subscribers, so in total this
means 443 new subscribers.

** TWITTER

Twitter had similar results. While it did gain more than 350 subscribers, it's
growth has been inconsistent and it even went negative a few times. It had 33639
at subscribers at the start and is currently at 33993.

** FACEBOOK

While the Youtube and the Twitter do provide hope, the Facebook-statistics show
us a sorry sight. It has almost constantly bled followers, after the immediate
hype over the Oddwall starting faded. It has since almost reached the same
number of followers it had before the Oddwall started. The Facebook had 156943
subscribers in the beginning and now has 156957.
