<p>While pondering about the lore, one may wonder, how did the whole slave-master
relationship happen between the Glukkons and the Mudokons? It might seem
plausible, that this was “always the case” or that this is not known, the real
answer is far more interesting in my opinion.</p>

<p>It is said, that eons ago (remember Oddworld being ten times as big as Earth,
evolves far slower) the Mudokons and the Glukkons lived together in relative
harmony. They both practiced mysticism and nothing would have stopped
this peace, except that one day a Mudokon paw appeared on the moon orbiting
Oddworld.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Rapture for some… Literal hell for others.</p>

<p>For the Mudokons, this meant an absolute sign of supremacy. The paw was the sign
of the Gods, telling everyone that they were the chosen species. But to the
Glukkons, this was an absolute disaster. Not wanting to endure this kind of
humiliation, they decided to turn to Alchemy with the intention to disprove the
Mudokons’ claim. Then… something happened. The details were never
disclosed, but Lanning described it as a “disaster”, which nearly drove them to
extinction. This combined with their incapability to challenge the Mudokons’
beliefs drove the grief-stricken Glukkons underground, who swore never to look
at the moon again.</p>

<p>Thus began the Age of Science. Throwing religion aside, the Glukkons instead
began experimenting and inventing technology. This made them very powerful
compared to the Mudokons, who at the time lived as spiritual advisors to other
speices. Sadly, because their old hate never faded, instead of letting go of
the past, the Glukkons had no problems with exploiting and enslaving the
creatures they once called their friends.</p>

<p>It’s quite a tragic story and I believe with this in mind you can’t really say
that “Mudokons are Good” and “Glukkons are Evil”, because neither party is
innocent.</p>

<p>There is, however, a problem. The canon actually branches in two ways and
one of these branches makes this whole event simply not possible. Lanning has
once said, that they originally intended that when Abe escaped from
RuptureFarms, there would have been a huge meteor shower, which would have
slowly carved out the paw, while our hero navigated the Stockyards. While it
would have been an amazing sight to see, it would have also removed the reason
for the Schism to happen in the fist place, hereby rendering the entire story
impossible. Despite this branch being an interesting piece of trivia, I think
it’s not a stretch to consider this just a “what-if” version of the lore and
instead consider the other one the “true” canonical events.</p>

<hr />

<p>Until this point, I mainly dealt with facts<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, but why not speculate a bit?
While it is mentioned, that the Glukkons gave up on mysticism, this doesn’t
actually seem to be the whole truth<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, especially with the recent promotional
material of Soulstorm<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. Not only are there multiple pieces of concept art(4,5)
depicting Industrialist priests, but as the interview states occultism shares a
major part in giving the Glukkons such power and influence.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TQ9MH21.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I believe what they worship is in fact money itself (or more specifically
Moolah), whose power manifests in a similar way to the Mudokons’ Chi. In the
previous games Abe only fought relatively small fishes, neither Molluck, nor the
Glukkon triumvirate or the Brewmaster could be considered even relatively
powerful, so we haven’t yet seen anything from when Glukkons - feeling
threatened by Abe’s seemingly unstoppable march - stop using Sligs and instead
call upon the wrath of their “god”.</p>

<p>The specifics of this is of course up to everyone’s imagination, but if the
Mudokons can call down a natural disaster - like the thunderstorm that destroyed
RuptureFarms -, them wouldn’t it be fitting if the Glukkons utilized the
pinnacle of artificial destruction, the perfect avatar of the cruel, immoral and
power-hungry nature of them: A giant nuclear bomb.</p>
