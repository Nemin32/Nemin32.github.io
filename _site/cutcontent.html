    <h1 id="a-few-interesting-things-cut-from-the-games">A few interesting things cut from the games</h1>

<p>On this page I’m collecting interesting facts from the canon that I found, that don’t really belong anywhere else. The texts between quotation marks and in Italics are directly quoted from Oddworld’s first artbook, <em>The Art of Oddworld Inhabitants: The First 10 Year</em></p>

<h2 id="exoddus">Exoddus</h2>

<h3 id="mudombies">“Mudombies”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>:</h3>

<p><img src="/imgs/mudombie2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p class="subtitle">Freaky!</p>

<p><img src="/imgs/mudombie.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p class="subtitle">Also older variants of the Fleeches, they resemble furless Fuzzles.</p>

<p>Abe’s Exoddus would have originally featured zombified Mudokons, whom Abe would
have needed to lead to their resting place. Presumably we would have
encountered them in the jungles of Necrum or in the Vaults. My guess as for why
they were cut is that presumably they wouldn’t have been too different compared
to ‘normal’ Mudokons and the disk space was scarce.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Page 121]</p>

  <p>Mudombies are Mudokon Spirits who cannot rest because their beloved burial
grounds of Necrum are being strip-mined by the Glukkons. In a nutshell, they are
hulking, idiot, zombie Mudokons.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The concept was later used in another ultimately cut gameplay feature, where
Abe would have slowly became a Mudombie himself, after sustaining enough
damage.</p>

<h3 id="elum">Elum<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>:</h3>

<p>If you rescued all 300 Mudokons, Abe would have had the chance to venture back
into the ruins of RuptureFarms to rescue the Elum and then they would have made
a big escape from the still-smouldering facility.</p>

<h3 id="guardians">Guardians:</h3>

<p><img src="/imgs/guardian.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p class="subtitle">Despite their ability, that orifice has a very unfortunate appearance.</p>

<p>Not strictly cut, as they do appear in the final product, but their purpose is
never explained in-game. The artbook writes about them the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Page 115: ABE ESCAPES]</p>

  <p>“Abe lands upon the remains of a Necrum guardian. Guardians are remnants of
  ancient protectors. Long before the Glukkons ever knew about Necrum, the
  guardians were its sentinels, protectors of the sacred place and the Mudokons
  buried there. When alive these guardians had the unique ability of spitting
  fiery globbers of vengeance from the orifice between their horns.”</p>

<h2 id="munchs-oddysee">Munch’s Oddysee</h2>

<h3 id="social-status">Social status<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>:</h3>

<p>At one point in development, back when MO was still planned to be a much more
grandious game, it was planned that each character you meet would have a
certain social status, which you could manipulate. Lanning explains it through
the example of a Slig:</p>

<p>Basically if you possess a Slig who is “nobody” (that is he has cheap
equipment), no one will take him seriously and certain areas won’t open up
to you, until you manage to upgrade your possessed character’s status. If
you were to approach a group of Sligs and tell them to follow you, they
would just laugh and tell you to sod off. But if you tried again, this time
wearing the coolest gear a Slig can dream of, they would do anything for
you without a word.</p>

<p>Also characters would have spoken to each other differently. The GameSpeak would
still have just one button for “Greetings”, but your character would have said
different things to different characters. The aforementioned Slig for example
would have just simply yelled at a Mudokon when you pressed the button, but if
you encountered a Glukkon, your Slig would have immediately became as polite as
they possibly can. This entire feature was sadly cut from the game.</p>

<h3 id="lulus-original-journey">Lulu’s original journey<sup id="fnref:3:1"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>:</h3>

<p>While the basic concept is mostly unchanged, Lulu was supposed to go
through a much more exciting path to become a Glockstar. Munch and Abe
would have had a lot more to directly do with him, unlike in the finished
game where he is possessed once and that’s it.</p>

<p>He would have been a lowly Pud (the ‘rank’ of the least successful
Glukkons) in a small meat packing factory, where his boss, a Glukkon named
Sask, would have threatened him that if he doesn’t do his job and slaughter
a few Scrabs for their meat, he would be fired.</p>

<p>From this point, it’s your job to make the best of the situation. You
could have either done it as you were asked and butcher the animals, which
would have resulted in negative Quarma. Or you could have chosen a
similarly brutal (albeit for some reason more positive) way of dealing with
the problem and murder a bunch of unsuspecting Sligs who were having a
picnic nearby for their meat. This way you would have also made some scrap
metal which would have made Lulu’s boss very happy.</p>

<p>By doing enough errands in Lulu’s name, he would have quickly been
promoted to the top and as a Glockstar, he would have gained access to
Vykkers Labs and by exploiting him Abe and Munch could have got Sam (by the
original plans, we would have met the Mudokon queen in this game) and the
Gabbiar out safely.</p>

<h3 id="rts">“RTS”<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>:</h3>

<p>Another really ambitious idea was that Abe was supposed to be able to direct
entire factories by possessing their leading Glukkons. This way you could have
affected the Industrialists on a major scale. Also the terrain around you would
have been dynamic and your choices could have changed them into becoming
healthier or more polluted.</p>

<h3 id="abe-and-munchs-disfunctional-partnership-roid">Abe and Munch’s disfunctional partnership, Roid:</h3>

<p><img src="/imgs/roid.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>One might notice that Munch and Abe become friends incredibly quickly and
without any fanfare in Munch’s Oddysee. Originally this would have been largely
different.</p>

<p>One of the first designs of Munch was a tapeworm, that Abe regurgiated
any time he needed him. This was quickly scrapped and replaced with
something more akin to what we got in the final version, but it would have
been lot less about the duo cooperating and more about Abe carrying Munch
around on a wheelchair, with him having no word about where they should go.</p>

<p>Also at one point it was planned that Munch, after all the experiments that
had been done on him by the Vykkers, would have developed a kind of Mr.
Hyde like personality, which would have manifested as a mindless, hulking,
muscle-bound beast called Roid. And the ‘best’ part is to call upon this
creature Abe would have had to punch and beat Munch until he went
mental.</p>

<p>You can read more about this aspect of Munch in this excerpt from The Art of Oddworld: The First
10 years:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Munch’s initial idea was an exciting one as he was to have a Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde type quality about him. He was to begin as a creature
that was the sole survivor of his species. But he was being held captive
as a laboratory-testing subject, and was being experimented upon with
adrenal steroids. His plight was to escape the laboratories of this
horrific processed food / pharmaceutical research facility and in the
process instigate the return of his species.</p>

  <p>He was a twerpy and somewhat pathetic looking little guy with a big heart
and the face only a mother could love - at least on the surface. At the
time, we were aiming to create meaningful (gameplay valid) emotions in a
game character and we wanted to use an emotional dynamic to trigger the
transformation into his Hyde-like alter ego.</p>

  <p>If he were angered in the game experience, his emotional state was
intended to trigger a metamorphosis into this huge and gruesome alter ego
- who would be called Roid. Roid would be similar to the Hulk in that he
would have a limited time to be this incredibly super strong b adass with
bone crunching physical abilities. A complete flip from his normal self.
The idea was to create this extreme yin &amp; yang trait for a new hero.</p>

  <p>Then reality hit as the land of gamedom is constantly faced with
technological challenges. It wasn’t long before we found ourselves to be
in too deep. We were too ambitious on this idea and didn’t really have the
chops or the resources at the time to pull it off as it was originally
conceived. A huge lesson learned.</p>

  <p>The rest of the production was a process that could be referred as
“reactionary design”. It’s what happens when an idea isn’t able to
manifest well, but production is already under way, and the only solution
left is to figure out how to get something viable completed. In many
cases, the “reactionary design” process is standard par for the game
industry, as this is an incredibly challenging medium to execute well. In
the end, the collision with reality changed the story drastically and also
shaped the game into what it was when it released with the Xbox. It was an
award-winning game, but Munch wound up being himself, and his darker
Hyde-side never manifested for the gamer to play.”</p>
