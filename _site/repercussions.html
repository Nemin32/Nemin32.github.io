<p><img src="imgs/slig.png" alt="" /></p>

<p class="subtitle">“I’m telling ya’, it’s that Abe guy! Sell! Dump it! Lose it! Get rid of it!”</p>

<p>We can witness a Slig saying this memorable line, while he flails his
arm wildly in one of the cutscenes of Abe’s Exoddus. While the scene is
definitely humorous, It contains some of the best parts of released lore
hidden in it in my opinion. Until this scene happened Abe’s exploits were
always a bit “isolated”. Sure some facilities went down in flames after he
has visited them and neither of the leading Glukkons lived through meeting
him alive, but we never once saw the world itself responding to the
situation.</p>

<p>Yet in this little clip, hiding behind the funny characters, we
see nothing else than a stock market display. And those who have keen eyes
can notice a very alarming thing on this screen. Every stock is in red and
all the arrows point downwards. These prices are falling, the Magog is in
big trouble. The aforementioned Slig is trying to make the best of the
situation by instructing whoever is on the other side of the phone
(presumably another Slig) to sell the stocks while they’re still worth
something.</p>

<p>And before anyone thinks this is seeing too much into a background, it is very
much not. At the EGX Soulstorm presentation Lanning has spent several minutes
explaining the “ripples” Abe’s actions caused to the greater Industrialist
hierarchy, which shows that yes, this was planned a long time ago.</p>

<p class="subtitle">On the left side we can see RuptureFarms burning down,
on the right the new design of Molluck in Soulstorm.</p>

<p>The Mudokon uprising is actually such a big problem, that Lady Margaret, current
leader of the Magog Cartel and Glukkon queen can’t deal with it herself. Molluck
is gone and the Investors demand an explanation or else she will be the one who
pays for their wasted financial support. Not knowing how to deal with the
situation, she actually had to turn to her grandmother, who suffers from a
deadly illness named “Gorman Disenza”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The symptoms of this disease are not known, but it is lethal and it only
affects the very wealthy. There is no known cure, but the process can be
halted by criogenically freezing the patient. This is what happened to the
elderly queen, who has less than fifty unfrozen days left of her life.</p>

<p>Because of this one can imagine how furious she was when her grandchild
unfreezes her for something so “trivial” as a slave uprising. While
Margaret is cruel and would gladly decimate the Mudokon population to teach
them their place, her grandmother is different. Next to her antagonistical
nature nearly every other Industrialist character is almost symphatetic.
Her opinion about the situation is that Margaret shouldn’t play around. She
should bring out the big guns, salt the earth and genocide every single
Mudokon who has any suspicion on themselves of supporting the uprising.</p>

<p>I won’t even try justifying this character’s action as she doesn’t deserve it,
but there is an important notion here: She choses this method, because even she
is afraid of their Investors. Let this sink in: The elderly leader of a huge
cartel, spanning over several factories, controlling a small army is so gravely
afraid of the people who pay her that she won’t even consider anything less
than total eradication. What could they be like then?</p>
