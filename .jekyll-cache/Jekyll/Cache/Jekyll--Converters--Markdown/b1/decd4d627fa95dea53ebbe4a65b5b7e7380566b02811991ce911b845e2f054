      <h1>A few thoughts on Molluck</h1>

      <p><i>The following essay is an amalgamation of canon lore, parts of the
          unreleased canon as explained to me by <a href="https://www.oddworldforums.net/member.php?u=7322">kjjcarpenter</a> (one
          of the few - as I like to call them - "Lore-gurus", also known as people who extensively
          studied and memorized Oddworld's released and unreleased canon) and my
          personal thoughts and findings on the character.  While I was striving to retell the
          lore here as accurately as possible, please don't take anything here that isn't sourced or
          you don't absolutely know is canon as fact. Enjoy!</i></p>

      <p>Today I'd like to talk a bit about the big bad, the "meanest boss in the world",
        the guy whose malicious intentions you don't need to be told about, Molluck the
        Glukkon.</p>

      <img src="imgs/molluck_concept.jpg" />

      <p class="subtitle">An early concept art of Molluck, wearing a less sophisticated and bulkier Magog Cartel logo.</p>

      <p>Playing only Abe's Oddysee and Abe's Exoddus and not having cared about the
        intended storyline of Munch's Oddysee, one might think that he's really the top
        of the foodchain, hell maybe even the owner of the Magog Cartel. The truth is
        more complex than this and it might be surprising to some. Molluck is in fact
        the prodigal son of <a href="trial.html">Lady Margaret</a>(1), the actual current owner of the cartel.  The
        Glukkon queen gave the task of running RuptureFarms (along with a few other factories,
        we'll get to that) as a test to Molluck to prove his worth before he gets an
        actually large turf.</p>

      <p>While you might think that RuptureFarms is the "biggest meat processing
        plant on Oddworld", it's not, Abe only says this, because he is so
        sheltered from the outside world. The number part in RF1029 is not a
        codeword, it's a serial number, meaning the factory has more than a
        thousand brethren. And while it might seem huge to us, Oddworld has ten
        times as much surface area as Earth so even a "smaller" factory like RF is,
        is multiple times larger than the largest ones on Earth.</p>

      <p>In fact, Mudos (the continent where all the currently released titles
        take place) is actually kind of a paralell to Africa, with backwater
        factories (like the ones we visit in Oddysee and Exoddus) that employ - and
        exploit - the less developed natives. This is why it is a huge shock to the
        cartel that a Mudokon-uprising could actually bring down a factory. It's
        about as believeable to the Investors and senior members like a group of
        tribals with spears and warpaint winning against a modern army.</p>

      <p>I mentioned other facilities, so let's continue with that. This might
        not be a surprise to some, but I think it's important to point out that
        Molluck was behind everything we've seen in the first two games. Not only
        did he own RuptureFarms, he's also the boss of the Glukkon trio seen in
        Abe's Exoddus and the owner of their facilities. Aslik being
        <i>Vice</i>-President is already a big tell, but Dripik even points out
        that "[He's] gonna be pissed" and that "if he ever comes back [they're]
        screwed", making it undisputable who's the boss after all(2). However, it
        might be a bigger surprise that Aslik isn't the Vice-President of FeeCo,
        instead he is VP of SoulStorm Brewery(3), also owned by Molluck(4). The
        Brewmaster is, despite his pompous title, just some lackey, who was
        ambitious (and perhaps competent) enough to take over in the boss'
        absence.</p>

      <p class="subtitle">The messy interior of the destroyed vault.</p>

      <p>He also owned a personal vault in RuptureFarms, which - as the pictures
        imply - contained some of his most treasured belongings, including a lot of
        Moolah. The painting hanging on the background was especially interesting
        to me, as it portrays a young Molluck standing sheepishly next to his
        always menacing mother, which is not exactly a side of him one can see a
        lot. Another thing I noticed was the chair, which is surprisingly similar
        to what you could find here on Earth. With Glukkon anatomy being so
        different, one can't help but wonder how would they even sit on a chair
        like this.</p>

      <p class="subtitle">A piece of concept art from the cancelled Oddworld
        movie: Molluck observing some of the many hanging Mudokon cells, where the
        tired workers return to get as much rest as they possibly can.</p>

      <p>Even his name was a clever choice as it is a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch">Moloch</a>, the Biblical
        false god of child sacrifice. The children here of course being the
        offspring of Sam, the Mudokons. Despite this - and some might disagree - I
        don't think Molluck is such a clear-cut evil character as the games portray
        him.</p>

      <p>The slaughter of innocents is an unforgivable choice and I'm not trying
        to justify it, however, it's not like there were any better alternatives
        either.  Remember, Molluck had to satisfy not only his very demanding mother,
        but also the vicious group of Investors. And as Abe tells us, the
        "profits were grim".  Quite likely if he hadn't made a choice like this, he
        and his colleagues would have ended up on the chopping block, with someone
        even crueller, but also more efficient taking over.</p>

      <p>I'd like to end this post with the short timeline of what happened to
        him after the end of Abe's Oddysee. As we seen in the canon good ending,
        the Mudokons conjure a mystical thunderstorm over RuptureFarms and struck
        the nearby Slig to death with a well aimed lightning bolt. The same fate
        follows Molluck, whose suit disintegrates, revealing the Glukkons'
        surprising anatomy. Except...</p>

      <p>He doesn't actually die. Either with a huge amount of luck or the
        meddling of Oddworldian gods, Molluck is 'merely' knocked unconscious and
        branded by the electricity passing through his head. The storm causes the
        factory to erupt in flames, however, Molluck gets himself together before
        he burns alive and escapes by unknown means. The authorities raid the
        factory, but since they can't find his corpse he is declared wanted for
        causing a loss of profit to the cartel.</p>

      <p>The lore here becomes quite vague. Where, how and when this happens is
        not known, but one thing is sure: Molluck, despite his best intentions to
        hide from the Cartel, was finally captured and he was brought before his
        very angry mother(5), who has to answer to the investors for his son's
        mistakes. After a likely thunderous and devastating scolding by Margaret,
        Molluck is escorted to an elevator to meet and to try to explain himself
        before the investors. This is where the known lore ends about him, and thus
        his fate is left unknown, but knowing who's he up against, I don't think he
        has a chance..</p>

      <p class="subtitle">Molluck in Soulstorm</p>

      <p>What little we know of Soulstorm seems to mostly follow this plotline
        with a few modifications(6). Molluck here tries to warn the other Glukkons
        about the dangers of Abe, but they think Molluck is just in for the
        insurance money and he was caught. And because of their prejudice, Abe will
        be able to succeed. Also we can see the guild which Molluck belongs to, the
        Stockgluks, whose job is to breed and provide creatures for the
        industry.</p>
