<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> What you read here is mostly speculation and aimless
headcanon, sprinkled with a few facts. The information referenced from
interviews are the closest we have to a greater Oddworld canon, so I handle them
as canon.</p>

<p>Ever since I got deeper into the vast Lore of Oddworld, I always wondered
about the daily life of the creatures, who inhabit this strange place. Since the
games never really touched on this subject, there is hardly any information
released on them, but using what little there is available, itâ€™s still fun to
speculate.</p>

<p><img src="imgs/nolybab.png" /></p>

<p>First things first, how do these cities look? Lanning describes these(1) as
vast underground cities that go deep into the planetâ€™s crust. The inhabitants,
who are described as â€œthe parasites, fleas in suits and ties, tape-worms with
lapelsâ€ need a damp place to survive as - opposed to our planet Earth, - Oddworld is
a mostly dry planet.</p>

<p><img src="imgs/labor_union.jpg" /></p>

<p>I speculate that because of this, the entire city is upside down compared to
our standards. The lowly workers and other creatures - think non-slave Mudokons
and perhaps even Sligs - live in the top levels, where itâ€™s relatively dry and
hot, this place would be the closest to what we find normal. Below them live the
not-so-fortunate Glukkons, whose eyes canâ€™t properly deal with natural light(2)
and other small-time business owners of different species. Taking one step up in
the chain of hierarchy, instead of having their offices in skyscrapers, the big
fish of the Oddworldian megacorporations try to have their offices as deep as
they can afford, where itâ€™s comfortably wet and dark, with every queen having
her own turf, which she fiercely defends. Even below them in breathtaking
depths, dwell the most influential creatures of the Industrialists, the
Investors and major Khanzumerz(3). These creatures have been described as
gargantuan monstrosities, who could easily wreck havoc, if they werenâ€™t appeased
with the products the Glukkons provided them.</p>

<p>Presumably similar to how their factories work, these cities are littered
with vending machines for nearly everything one can imagine and even if you can
avoid these taking all your Moolah, you still need to deal with shady beings on
every corner, whoâ€™ll try their best to rip you off by offering products of
questionable origin and quality at a â€œvery good priceâ€. The streets are filled
with cars and other vehicles, all flying at incredible speed. Jaywalking almost
always results in death, so few even try. In my headcanon, a creature rarely
leaves the level itâ€™s living on, as you can find everything you want (and of
course afford) there and going to a lower level would increase the chances of
you running into someone youâ€™d find quite unpleasant.</p>

<p>Since everything is corporationalized, law enforcement is generally lacking
and the corruption is rampant. Small-time crimes - like theft,
muggings or beatings - are prevalent on higher levels, meaning the meeker,
weaker or poorer inhabitants rarely step out of their homes at night. The
general population is kept docile and obedient with soul-crushingly long
workdays, hardly any free time and constant propaganda flowing freely from the
media. The stress, the unhealthy lifestyle and the decadence prevents most citizens
from ever reaching old age, with caridac arrest being the leading cause of
death.</p>

<p>On the lower levels, things are quite different. As there are a lot important
people living and working here the streets are well guarded, thus petty
criminals arenâ€™t frequent here. However, the same canâ€™t be said about organized
crime. Companies and mafias go hand in hand and the nights are frequently loud
from gangs â€˜solvingâ€™ their disputes. As they are likely candidates for becoming
hostages, the leadership of these companies use heavily armored cars or when
this is not possible, employ dozens of bodyguards, who - for the right price -
guard them whenever they need to step out their offices. On the lowest levels
there is virtually no unrest. Even the deadliest rivals - who in any other
situation wouldnâ€™t hesitate to jump at each otherâ€™s throats - put their
differences aside, pull their necks in and try to put on their most convincing
smiles, not to provoke the Khanzumerz and die a gruesome death.</p>

<p>All in all, if I had to describe these cities with a metaphor, Iâ€™d say
theyâ€™re similar to fruits, who from the outside look perfect, but inside they
rot and are infested with worms.</p>

    <p><em>â€œSo we have these craters, and then out of these huge shells of collapsed
earth that go down thousands of feet, theyâ€™ve built cities. When youâ€™re
looking across the landscape, you can see just the tips of cities coming out

and heâ€™s being taken to the boss and he passes his mom who says â€œYou blew it,â€
and he has to go down and meet the investors. They live underground; like how
I said about how the world is separated. He takes an elevator ride down 1700
storeys and a little midget guys picks you up as an escort, but as you go down
and the temperature increases, theyâ€™re getting bigger and bigger, while the
security guards from up above are dying and sweltering from the heat.â€</em></p>
