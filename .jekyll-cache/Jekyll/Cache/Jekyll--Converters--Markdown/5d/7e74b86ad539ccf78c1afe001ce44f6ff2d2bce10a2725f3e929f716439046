  While pondering about the lore, one may wonder, how did the whole slave-master
    relationship happen between the Glukkons and the Mudokons? It might seem
    plausible, that this was "always the case" or that this is not known, the real
    answer is far more interesting in my opinion.
  It is said, that eons ago (remember Oddworld being ten times as big as Earth,
    evolves far slower) the Mudokons and the Glukkons lived together in relative
    harmony. They both practiced mysticism and nothing would have stopped
    this peace, except that one day a Mudokon paw appeared on the moon orbiting
    Oddworld.

  &lt;p class = "subtitle"&gt;Rapture for some... Literal hell for others.

  For the Mudokons, this meant an absolute sign of supremacy. The paw was the sign
    of the Gods, telling everyone that they were the chosen species. But to the
    Glukkons, this was an absolute disaster. Not wanting to endure this kind of
    humiliation, they decided to turn to Alchemy with the intention to disprove the
    Mudokons' claim. Then... something happened. The details were never
    disclosed, but Lanning described it as a "disaster", which nearly drove them to
    extinction. This combined with their incapability to challenge the Mudokons'
    beliefs drove the grief-stricken Glukkons underground, who swore never to look
    at the moon again.

  &lt;img src="imgs/city.jpg"&gt;

  Thus began the Age of Science. Throwing religion aside, the Glukkons instead
    began experimenting and inventing technology. This made them very powerful
    compared to the Mudokons, who at the time lived as spiritual advisors to other
    speices. Sadly, because their old hate never faded, instead of letting go of
    the past, the Glukkons had no problems with exploiting and enslaving the
    creatures they once called their friends.

  It's quite a tragic story and I believe with this in mind you can't really say
    that "Mudokons are Good" and "Glukkons are Evil", because neither party is
    innocent.
  
  There is, however, a problem. The canon actually branches in two ways and
    one of these branches makes this whole event simply not possible. Lanning has
    once said, that they originally intended that when Abe escaped from
    RuptureFarms, there would have been a huge meteor shower, which would have
    slowly carved out the paw, while our hero navigated the Stockyards. While it
    would have been an amazing sight to see, it would have also removed the reason
    for the Schism to happen in the fist place, hereby rendering the entire story
    impossible. Despite this branch being an interesting piece of trivia, I think
    it's not a stretch to consider this just a "what-if" version of the lore and
    instead consider the other one the "true" canonical events.

  &lt;hr&gt;

  Until this point, I mainly dealt with facts(1), but why not speculate a bit?
    While it is mentioned, that the Glukkons gave up on mysticism, this doesn't
    actually seem to be the whole truth(2), especially with the recent promotional
    material of Soulstorm(3). Not only are there multiple pieces of concept art(4,5)
    depicting Industrialist priests, but as the interview states occultism shares a
    major part in giving the Glukkons such power and influence.

  &lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/TQ9MH21.jpg"&gt;

  I believe what they worship is in fact money itself (or more specifically
    Moolah), whose power manifests in a similar way to the Mudokons' Chi. In the
    previous games Abe only fought relatively small fishes, neither Molluck, nor the
    Glukkon triumvirate or the Brewmaster could be considered even relatively
    powerful, so we haven't yet seen anything from when Glukkons - feeling
    threatened by Abe's seemingly unstoppable march - stop using Sligs and instead
    call upon the wrath of their "god".

  The specifics of this is of course up to everyone's imagination, but if the
    Mudokons can call down a natural disaster - like the thunderstorm that destroyed
    RuptureFarms -, them wouldn't it be fitting if the Glukkons utilized the
    pinnacle of artificial destruction, the perfect avatar of the cruel, immoral and
    power-hungry nature of them: A giant nuclear bomb.

    Q: So there?s Industrial occultism as well as the Native spiritualism?
