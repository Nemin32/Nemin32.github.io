    <h1>On the cities of the Industrialists</h1>
    <p><b>DISCLAIMER:</b> What you read here is mostly speculation and aimless
    headcanon, sprinkled with a few facts. The information referenced from
    interviews are the closest we have to a greater Oddworld canon, so I handle them
    as canon.</p>

    <p>Ever since I got deeper into the vast Lore of Oddworld, I always wondered
    about the daily life of the creatures, who inhabit this strange place. Since the
    games never really touched on this subject, there is hardly any information
    released on them, but using what little there is available, it's still fun to
    speculate.</p>

    <p>First things first, how do these cities look? Lanning describes these(1) as
    vast underground cities that go deep into the planet's crust. The inhabitants,
    who are described as "the parasites, fleas in suits and ties, tape-worms with
    lapels" need a damp place to survive as - opposed to our planet Earth, - Oddworld is
    a mostly dry planet.</p>

    <img src = "imgs/labor_union.jpg">

    <p>I speculate that because of this, the entire city is upside down compared to
    our standards. The lowly workers and other creatures - think non-slave Mudokons
    and perhaps even Sligs - live in the top levels, where it's relatively dry and
    hot, this place would be the closest to what we find normal. Below them live the
    not-so-fortunate Glukkons, whose eyes can't properly deal with natural light(2)
    and other small-time business owners of different species. Taking one step up in
    the chain of hierarchy, instead of having their offices in skyscrapers, the big
    fish of the Oddworldian megacorporations try to have their offices as deep as
    they can afford, where it's comfortably wet and dark, with every queen having
    her own turf, which she fiercely defends. Even below them in breathtaking
    depths, dwell the most influential creatures of the Industrialists, the
    Investors and major Khanzumerz(3). These creatures have been described as
    gargantuan monstrosities, who could easily wreck havoc, if they weren't appeased
    with the products the Glukkons provided them.</p>

    <p>Presumably similar to how their factories work, these cities are littered
    with vending machines for nearly everything one can imagine and even if you can
    avoid these taking all your Moolah, you still need to deal with shady beings on
    every corner, who'll try their best to rip you off by offering products of
    questionable origin and quality at a "very good price". The streets are filled
    with cars and other vehicles, all flying at incredible speed. Jaywalking almost
    always results in death, so few even try. In my headcanon, a creature rarely
    leaves the level it's living on, as you can find everything you want (and of
    course afford) there and going to a lower level would increase the chances of
    you running into someone you'd find quite unpleasant.</p>

    <p>Since everything is corporationalized, law enforcement is generally lacking
    and the corruption is rampant. Small-time crimes - like theft,
    muggings or beatings - are prevalent on higher levels, meaning the meeker,
    weaker or poorer inhabitants rarely step out of their homes at night. The
    general population is kept docile and obedient with soul-crushingly long
    workdays, hardly any free time and constant propaganda flowing freely from the
    media. The stress, the unhealthy lifestyle and the decadence prevents most citizens
    from ever reaching old age, with caridac arrest being the leading cause of
    death.</p>

    <p>On the lower levels, things are quite different. As there are a lot important
    people living and working here the streets are well guarded, thus petty
    criminals aren't frequent here. However, the same can't be said about organized
    crime. Companies and mafias go hand in hand and the nights are frequently loud
    from gangs 'solving' their disputes. As they are likely candidates for becoming
    hostages, the leadership of these companies use heavily armored cars or when
    this is not possible, employ dozens of bodyguards, who - for the right price -
    guard them whenever they need to step out their offices. On the lowest levels
    there is virtually no unrest. Even the deadliest rivals - who in any other
    situation wouldn't hesitate to jump at each other's throats - put their
    differences aside, pull their necks in and try to put on their most convincing
    smiles, not to provoke the Khanzumerz and die a gruesome death.</p>

    <p>All in all, if I had to describe these cities with a metaphor, I'd say
    they're similar to fruits, who from the outside look perfect, but inside they
    rot and are infested with worms.</p>

    <i>"So we have these craters, and then out of these huge shells of collapsed
      earth that go down thousands of feet, they?ve built cities. When you?re
      looking across the landscape, you can see just the tips of cities coming out
      of these craters. But they?re not craters so much as large pockets."</i></p>

    <i>"There are scenes in the film I want to do where Mullock, after he fucked up
      and he?s being taken to the boss and he passes his mom who says ?You blew it,?
      and he has to go down and meet the investors. They live underground; like how
      I said about how the world is separated. He takes an elevator ride down 1700
      storeys and a little midget guys picks you up as an escort, but as you go down
      and the temperature increases, they?re getting bigger and bigger, while the
      security guards from up above are dying and sweltering from the heat."</i></p>
