      <h1>Missing In Oddtion</h1>
      <h3>Projects that OWI started only to promptly cancel or forget about</h3>
    </header>
    <main>
      <p>Whether because of lack of interest or other reasons, there has
        been several projects which started promising only to completely
        disappear weeks or even days after they started.</p>
      <p>On this page I'd like to recount these, so that they won't be
        completely lost to history, along with a small description over
        what they were.</p>

      <h2>ARG Picture 5</h2>
      <img src="imgs/pic5.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170224023128/http://oddworld.com/soulstorm/">Web Archive</a> link for the curious.</p>
      <p>Back in early 2017, before the first video teaser was
        released, there were five images teased that the community
        could unlock. However, if one would go and
        check <a href="https://oddworld.com/soulstorm">Soulstorm's
          site</a>, they would find that there are only four slots
        there. The fifth mysteriously disappeared with OWI saying
        that the ARG proceeded as planned.</p>

      
      <h2>Oddwall</h2>
      <img src="imgs/oddwall.jpg">
      <p>Supposedly not cancelled, just shelved because they don't
        have "something of interest" to show the community,
        the <a href="https://oddworld.com/oddwall">Oddwall</a> was a
        community game consisting of an image obscured by differently
        sized tiles and a more or less weekly poll about which one of
        these tiles should be revealed. Some sections were only
        unlocked after a certain number of subscribers were obtained
        on OWI's social media pages.</p>

      
      <h2>Lore tidbits</h2>
      <p>In July, 2018 OWI released a page
        titled <a href="http://oddworld.com/queens">Queens</a> sharing
        concept art and lore tidbits about Oddworld's queens, who are
        some of the most influental characters, despite not appearing in
        the games yet.</p>
      <p>The page launched with only Sam, the Mudokon queen's page,
        but over a few weeks it was updated several times with new
        images and pages for the other two queens Margaret and
        Skillya.</p>
      <p>While the community enjoyed the previously unseen concept
        art, the page's content received minor criticism over its
        factual inaccuracies. (For example, painting Lady Margaret as
        a ruthless villain, unfeeling for her sons, instead of the
        original concept where she was both a cruel businesswoman and
        a loving mother. Molluck's fall was especially painful because
        he was Margaret's prodigal child.) OWI, however, has claimed
        the content to be correct, which implies retconning or not
        wanting to give away plot points which only the fans who read
        old interviews could find.</p>

      
      <h2>Lost Archives</h2>
      <img class="small" src="imgs/insta_images/25022422_472243246504002_8271305566903599104_n.jpg">
      <p>The Lost Archives were one of the most ambitious recent
        projects of OWI. They set out to release images never yet seen
        on their <a href="https://instagram.com/oddworldinc">Instagram
        page</a> and they did it quite often, at times we could expect
        a new image daily. I made
        a <a href="foundarchives.html">page</a> where fans can view
        all of these images.</p>
      <p>However, one day the flow of images started to ebb and then
        stopped completely, leaving us with neither an explanation nor
        our usual share of pictures. As of this page's writing (13th
        of October, 2019.), it's been almost seven months since the
        last Lost Archives-related post.</p>

      
      <h2>Oddcast</h2>
      <p class="centered">

      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">An episode of the Oddcast, archived by Magog
      on the March. The rest can also be found on this channel.</p>
      <p>The Oddcast was the name of a free-form podcast OWI released
        every few months on a dedicated channel on their official
        Discord. But after only a few episodes, because of what I
        suspect to be lack of interest or perhaps lack of topics to
        speak about, the project stopped and recently the room too was
        deleted without a trace.</p>


      <h2>Wiki</h2>
      <p>The Wiki started as a fan initiative to unify the several
        already existing wikis about Oddworld into one peer-reviewed,
        trustable source of lore and information. Talks about it began
        in late August of 2018, but until very recently there was no
        public developments on this front.</p>
      <p>In June of 2019 OWI announced that they will soon launch the
        Wiki, with Xavier, owner and maintainer of several prominent
        Oddworld information databases and me as its curators.</p>
      <p>However, despite the wiki being in a fully functional
        condition, with several pages having written beginnings and
        multiple promises from OWI, the wiki project is still not
        live.</p>

      
      <h2>Dear Alf & Newsletter</h2>
      <p>Dear Alf was an online Q&A series in which Lorne Lanning
        answered fan questions from the in-universe perspective of Alf,
        Abe's friend. The series lasted remarkably long from the very
        early days till 2014, when it abruptly ended.</p>

      <p>Three years later Alf suddenly appeared again and answered
        another set of questions, ending his post with: <i>"That’s it
          for this week, pals – there’re a lot of things I need to catch
          up on around here, but I’ll be back next week answering more of
          your burning questions."</i> Safe to say, there hasn't been
        another proper Dear Alf ever since.</p>

      <p>However, this doesn't mean that Alf never returned, nor that
        the Q&A didn't continue, as OWI announced that they are going to
        release a newsletter that would air every few months. These
        issues contained seveal sections, mostly highlighting specific
        developers or recent happenings. In the third newsletter a new
        section, also titled Dear Alf appeared, where a few questions
        were answered. This is, however, much more subdued both in tone
        and quantity compared to the old series and also far less
        accessible.</p>

      <p>The most recent edition of the newsletter appeared in July.</p>
