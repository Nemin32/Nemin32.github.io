      <h2>OWI's abandoned projects</h2>

      <p>Throughout the years, there have been several projects
        started by OWI, which were shut down or simply abandoned way
        before they could reach proper maturity.</p>

      <p>On this page I'd like to recount these in a more or less chronological
        order, along with a small description for each, so that they won't be
        completely lost to history.</p>

      <h3>Happy Birthday Abe's Oddysee<br>(19. September 2019. - 23. September 2019.)</h3>
      <img src="imgs/miodd/happybd.jpg">
      <p>Abe's Oddysee has turned 22nd this year and OWI decided to celebrate
        the event with 22 of their favorite memories presented in quick one
        minute long videos, each having three or four of these memories in them.
        However, after just three episodes (containing 10 memories in total), the
        whole series stopped without a word.</p>


      <h3>Lore Quizzes<br>(11. June 2019. - 11. June 2019.)</h3>
      <img src="imgs/miodd/MO_Quiz.png">
      <p class="subtitle">The first and only Lore Quiz.</p>

      <p>A project that became dead on arrival, Lore Quizzes were an idea by
        OWI_Lewis with the intention to give us something to do while we were
        waiting for ARG and Soulstorm related news.</p>

      <p>However - likely because it didn't gain too much traction, - the
        project was discontinued (and quickly forgotten about by most people)
        after the release of just one quiz.</p>


      <h3>Oddwall<br>(May 2019 - June 2019)</h3>
      <img src="imgs/miodd/oddwall.jpg">
      <p>Supposedly not cancelled, just shelved because they don't
        have "something of interest" to show the community,
        the <a href="https://oddworld.com/oddwall">Oddwall</a> was a
        community game consisting of an image obscured by differently
        sized tiles and a more or less weekly poll about which one of
        these tiles should be revealed. Some sections were only
        unlocked after a certain number of subscribers were obtained
        on OWI's social media pages.</p>


      <h3>Dear Alf<br>(<span title="Original Dear Alf run by OWI">October 2000 - December 2004</span>,
        <span title="Dear Alf under Just Add Water">February 2011 -
          July 2014</span>,<br> <span title="Dear Alf 77">January
        2017</span>, <span title="Dear Alf in the third issue of the
        Oddworld Newsletter">April 2019</span>)<br>&<br>The Oddworld
        Newsletter<br>(April 2019 - July 2019)</h3>
      <img src="imgs/miodd/dearalf.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle">Compared to the old Dear Alf posts' 8-10
        questions and answers, this feels rather lacking.</p>
      <p>Dear Alf was an online Q&A series in which Lorne Lanning
        answered fan questions from the in-universe perspective of Alf,
        Abe's friend. The series lasted remarkably long from the very
        early days till 2014, when it abruptly ended.</p>

      <p>Three years later Alf suddenly appeared again and answered
        another set of questions, ending his post with: <i>"That’s it
          for this week, pals – there’re a lot of things I need to catch
          up on around here, but I’ll be back next week answering more of
          your burning questions."</i> Despite this promise, it took
        him one and a half years to appear again.</p>

      <p>His next cameo was in the third issue of the newsletter OWI
        announced around in April of 2019. These issues contained
        seveal sections, mostly highlighting specific developers or
        recent happenings. Alf's appearance was teased in the second
        newsletter, asking people to ask questions which will be
        answered soon. And as promised in the third newsletter a new
        section, also titled Dear Alf appeared, where he answered a
        few questions.</p>

      <p>These answers (see above) were, however,
        subdued both in tone and quantity compared to the old series,
        in which Alf answered around 10 questions every time, giving
        us insight into the perhaps bit more mundane, but just as
        interesting parts of Oddworld. These old questions and answers
        can be found <a href="PGYFT/index.html">here</a>.</p>


      <h3>Q&As<br>(<span title="Lorne Lanning Q&A">October 2018 - Ongoing</span> and <span title="Bennie Terry Q&A">August 2019 - Ongoing</span>)</h3>
      <p class="centered">

      </p>
      <p>After several weeks of discussion about a free-form community Q&A, I
        have decided to contact OWI about the idea, which they decided to
        greenlight. They asked me to collect questions that Lorne Lanning could
        answer, so I created a poll, which I shared on several unofficial
        platforms like Reddit, OWF and OWF's Discord and of course on
        OWI's own Discord server. In just one week we have received (after
        filtering out spam and such) 91 questions which I promptly sent in.</p>

      <p>For quite some time nothing happened. I have tried asking about it
        several times, but I've mostly received uncertain answers. Things have
        changed on September, 2019, when OWI released the first two parts of the
        Q&A, which answered a little less than ten questions in great detail.
        However, despite the almost unanimous positive reception, we haven't
        seen any new Q&A episodes since.</p>

      <p>In the meantime OWI also announced that they'll be doing a Q&A with
        Bennie Terry III and that they are looking for questions. The deadline
        was the first week of Septeber 2019, so at the time of writing, it's been
        more than a month since the last update on this project.</p>



      <h3>Wiki<br>(August 2018 - Ongoing)</h3>
      <p>The Wiki started as a fan initiative to unify the several
        already existing wikis about Oddworld into one peer-reviewed,
        trustable source of lore and information. Official talks about
        it began in late August of 2018, but until very recently there
        was very little public development on this front.</p>

      <p>In June of 2019 OWI announced that they will soon launch the
        Wiki, with Xavier, owner and maintainer of several prominent
        Oddworld information databases and me as its curators.</p>

      <p>However, despite the wiki being fully functional, with
        several pages having written beginnings and multiple promises
        from OWI, the wiki project is still not live.</p>



      <h3>Lore tidbits<br>(July 2018)</h3>
      <a id="back1"></a>
      <p>In July, 2018 OWI released a page
        titled <a href="http://oddworld.com/queens">Queens</a> sharing
        concept art and lore tidbits about Oddworld's queens, who are
        some of the most influental characters, despite not appearing in
        the games yet.</p>

      <p>The page launched with only Sam, the Mudokon queen's page,
        but over a few weeks it was updated several times with new
        images and pages for the other two queens Margaret and
        Skillya.</p>

      <p>While the community enjoyed the previously unseen concept
        art, the page's content received minor criticism over its
        factual inaccuracies. (For example, painting Lady Margaret as
        a ruthless villain, unfeeling for her sons, instead of the
        original concept where she was both a cruel businesswoman and
        a loving mother. Molluck's fall was especially painful because
        he was Margaret's prodigal child.<a href="#1">[1]</a>) OWI, however, has claimed
        the content to be correct, which implies retconning or not
        wanting to give away plot points which only the fans who read
        old interviews could find.</p>


      <h3>Oddcast<br>(April 2018 - Around July 2019)</h3>
      <p class="centered">
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AbG_Fg_gbC0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">An episode of the Oddcast, archived by Magog
        on the March. The rest can also be found on this channel.</p>

      <p>The Oddcast was the name of a free-form podcast OWI released
        every few months on a dedicated channel on their official
        Discord. But after only a few episodes, because of what I
        suspect to be lack of interest or perhaps lack of topics to
        speak about, the project stopped and recently the room too was
        deleted without a trace.</p>


      <h3>Lost Archives<br>(December 2017 - April 2019)</h3>
      <img class="small" src="imgs/insta_images/25022422_472243246504002_8271305566903599104_n.jpg">
      <p>The Lost Archives were perhaps one of the most ambitious recent
      projects of OWI. They <a href="http://www.oddworld.com/2017/12/announcing-oddworld-the-lost-archives/">set out</a>
      to release images never yet seen on their <a href="https://instagram.com/oddworldinc">Instagram page</a>
      every day until Soulstorm's launch. I made a <a href="foundarchives.html">page</a> where fans can view
        all of these images.</p>

      <p>However, one day the flow of images started to ebb and then
        stopped completely, leaving us with neither an explanation nor
        our usual share of pictures. As of this <span title="13th of October, 2019">page's writing</span>,
        it's been almost seven months since the last Lost Archives-related post.</p>


      <h3>Oddysee's source code<br>(December 2017 - <span title="Last mention of the source code by OWI">January 2019</span>)</h3>
      <p>Along with the Lost Archives project, OWI also announced that they
        have found the source code of Abe's Oddysee and that "[they]’ll have more
        to talk about on this in due course".</p>

      <p>However, aside from a few short messages about it on the official
        Discord server, nothing ever really came out of this project. You can see
        these messages below:</p>

      <h3>ARG Picture 5<br>(Around February 2017 -
      <span title="Placeholder disappeared">Around July
      2017</span> and <span title="OWI clarifies that everything went as planned">April 2018</span>)</h3>

      <p class="subtitle"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170224023128/http://oddworld.com/soulstorm/">Web Archive</a> link for the curious.</p>
      <p>Back in early 2017, before the first video teaser was
        released, there were five images teased that the community
        could unlock. However, if one would go and
        check <a href="https://oddworld.com/soulstorm">Soulstorm's
          site</a>, they would find that there are only four slots
        there. The fifth mysteriously disappeared with OWI saying
        that the ARG proceeded as planned.</p>
