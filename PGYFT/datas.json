Then the Glukkons started dabbling in the kinda magic no-one has any business playing around with. Maybe they were jealous.

You better brush up on your basic biology. Listen up: The female Mudokons are the queens, and you haven’t seen them yet. The male Mudokons are the drones, and you haven’t seen them yet either. The drones and the queens do all the breeding for the whole species, while most of us down in the trenches doing all the hard work are biologically sexless.

Fruits, leaves, grains, meat, fish, and anything we can cook out of them all. We have a broad palette. That’s part of the reason we get made slaves more than any other natives: we can live on the processed rubbish and byproduct sweepings. My favourite dessert is genodda cake! ", "tags": ["Mudokon"]},

{"question": "Abe can chant and possess an enemy when he’s crouched?", "answer": "Yeah he figured out how to do that not long before he went looking for Munch.

The question to end all questions except, logically, itself. One single Paramite up against one single Scrab? The Scrab would win. No sweat. The question should be how many Paramites would it take to guarantee the Scrab’s defeat. Or maybe it’s an extra large Paramite, or an extra small Scrab, or both! What about a Fleech-sized Scrab fighting a Sea Rex-sized Paramite? Or you could throw in an extra Scrab, so the two Scrabs fight each other while the Paramites scratch away at them from relative safety.

Perhaps he should try negotiating instead, and if that doesn’t work then he can go on to sabotage.", "answer": "Look buddy, I’ll be the first to admit that Abe ain’t the sharpest splinter in the plank, but it don’t take a degree in Glukkonomy to see that these industrial creeps pack their negotiation chambers with gas and spikes, not tea and biscuits.

But Sekto is something a hundred times worse. Sekto is an Oktigi.

Think about it! You’re running a business, making processed foods or yike parts or phatteries or whatever. Your success is your profit, your wealth, your status, and that’s how you dress: the finest tailored suits, the rarest jewelry, the widest shoulder pads anyone did ever see!

Vykkers live for about 120 years. That’s about three times your average Mudokon! But who can say how much is the natural lifespan Odd gave them and how much is bonus years they’ve scraped together with drugs, transplants and gene-splicing? Sligs are pretty useless. They survived by keeping out of everyone’s way. They spent their days feeling sorry for themselves. Not a surprise they jumped at the chance to take out their frustrations on lowly Mudokon slaves as soon as it was offered to them. A couple of jokes, hmmm. What do you call a Slig without pants?

Stranger may have started out looking after his own hide, even once he knew Sekto would be coming after him, but it’s only by discovering and embracing his noble heritage that he managed to accomplish that.

Right now tribes have all but dispanded, secretive clans hidden themselves away from industrialist meddling, far-flung vestiges of purer existence on the fringes of populated land.

Even then they’re competing for lands, contracts, marketing… don’t ever mistake them for friends! On the other hand, they’ll work together if they both feel they can get something out of it.

That’s not an inexpensive plan of operation! Get rid of the Vendos… what would the workers eat? A chant supressor every 10 feet… do you have any idea how much a self-powered anti-gravity tesla coil costs? A security code on grenade dispenzahs?

If he killed one by accident or if he was being mean, on purpose, all he could say was “oops” and move on, he didnt stop, cry or even apologise to friends nearby if he killed one of their buddies.", "answer": "Make no mistake, Abe feels pain and suffering and sadness, often in a much deeper way that the Mudokons around him.

{"question": "and why is it that slogs respect them so much that they would even attack a glukkon if a slig commanded it,", "answer": "Um, you said two questions. This is number three, but that’s fine. Slogs don’t respect Sligs. They obey them because they’ve been brutally raised to know they’ll get beaten, starved and generally abused if they don’t.

See now the Scrab is pretty good at getting things done: he tackles his problems head-on and doesn’t respond to silly, annoying questions with anything but a head-lowered, beak-extended charge attack. I like his style. But Paramites are easier to get along with, and as a fan liaison I need that image. So I think Mudomo is my answer. I’m not even gonna consider Fleeches. What’s wrong with you?

Elums get on perfectly well in groups but they also have no problem being on their own for indefinate stretches. It’s just another form of their hardiness.

That’s exactly how he swelled up around his mask. It was disgusting. I have no idea what robot Glukkons you’re thinking of.

It’s one of those long-forgotten practices that wise old Mudokon shamans spent their entire lives learning to perform for mere seconds at a time. There always has to be someone who comes along and shows everyone else up, and in the field of possession, that’s Abe. I don’t think Mudokons can possess each other.

Those fans who live in France, German, Italy or Spain probably disagree with what we speak. It’s translation for the sake of you guys that don’t understand the languages of Oddworld. The various races, cultures and classes on Oddworld all developed with their own languages and dialects.

Show me two demographics that do. ", "tags": ["Glukkon", "Slig", "Vykker"]},

{"question": "3.) Are Interns asexual or not? Do they have a queen? (Queen Ingrid?)", "answer": "Tell you what, make friends with one and give it their favourite grunge hop hip trop album, or whatever it is they listen to, for their birthday. Once you have their trust, invite them to the local milkshake salon (they can fit the straws between their mouth stitches) and see how far you get. And never, ever, under any circumstances inform me of your discoveries. ", "tags": []},

{"question": "4.) Where did Doc come from? Vykkers Lab or elsewhere?", "answer": "Considering Vykkers Labs smashed into the ground in a million pyrotechnic pieces, no, I don’t think Doc came from there. ", "tags": ["Vykker"]},

{"question": "5.) Are they three main races on Oddworld? Industrial, Native and Consumer, which includes Clakkerz and Outlaws? Or do they belong to one of the established two?", "answer": "Industrial, Native and Wildlife have been pretty useful classes so far, but there are always exceptions. Gabbits, for instance, can fit into either Native or Wildlife depending on what criteria you think are most important; they have language and other social intelligence, but no architecture or art or technology. We put Clakkerz in the ‘Settler’ category, and Outlaws in the ‘Outlaw’ category. In time our understanding of these categories and how they interact and overlap with others may come to grow substantially. ", "tags": ["Gabbit"]},

{"question": "6.) Why does only Sekto have Wolvarks? Where did they come from? Do they have a queen?", "answer": "There are many competing security companies on Oddworld, including Sligs and Wolvarks. Glukkons go with Sligs, Sekto goes with Wolvarks. It’s consumer choice!

{"question": "serhat: 1. dont know if u have seen munch or a gabbit b4 but how do they talk? they never use their tounge and hav got not very many teeth and their teeth r small", "answer": "Gabbits have fantastically versatile tongues that put yours and mine to shame, and can produce a massive range of vocalizations that let them immitate the languages of dozens of species. Conversely, they do have trouble with dental consonants for reasons you’ve already explained. ", "tags": ["Gabbit"]},

{"question": "2. wat do khanzumers look like? the guys that the glukkons make their products for", "answer": "I haven’t met them yet, but the Glukkons say they’re the most important people on the planet. They give them all the choices, all the luxuries, all the commoddities. I can only imagine they’re hereditarily rich beyond anyone’s wildest dreams, capable of funding the most important research AND buying a fleet of the fanciest of yachts, all from a single bank note, with enough change left over to melt down into crowns.

That is if the vykkers keeping Sam captive and carefully watching over the eggs made a slip up and let an egg holding a Queenling pass through their security…", "answer": "Well sure, I mean everything’s got to die at some point, right? Even Oktigi, I guess. And if the sole reproductive member of your species dies, you’ll really hope there were someone to take her place. So I guess there must be Queenlings, or maybe they’re called Princesses. ", "tags": ["Sam", "Mudokon"]},

In the old Munch’s Oddysee visualizations, there were rainmakers with these pink spooceshrubs around the edges called Humshrubs. How much more diffrent are they from Spooceshrubs? What do they have to offer? And more importantly… are they Tasty?", "answer": "Great Mother Odd gifted nature with more plants than you can shake a Stockyard at. The wisest shamans know which ones can be used to cure which ailments, and the specific rituals that have to be followed for them to work. SpooceShrubs, HumShrubs, BuzzShrubs, Popberries, they’re just the tiniest sampling of the rich floral medicine cabinet of nature.

{"question": " 3. Here’s my last question, are there any subspecies on Oddworld? Like a variation of Grubbb or Mudokon specifcally? Perhaps any hybrids?", "answer": "Well sure, any species distributed across enough natural environmental variation is going to produce significant variation in their genetics. Grubbs and Mudokons aren’t anywhere near evolutionarily related, you’re not going to see hybrids. For two species to cross-breed they’d need to be closely related, like Oktigi and Glukkons.

{"question": "matthew: i was just wondering how did abe get his mystical powers and can other mudokons learn it?", "answer": "Magic is like art or sport or logic: some people have it, some don’t. Some people are so bad they can’t be taught no matter how hard you try. Others are so good they can’t stop even if they want to. Abe has a lot of natural, latent mental powers that makes it easy for him to do this fancy pants stuff like possession, and you can sure bet it makes a lot of people jealous. Possession in particular should take decades of dedicated practise to pull off.

", "tags": ["Elum", "Abe", "Slog", "Fleech"]},

{"question": "Alec: So, Alf, tell me the story behind Shrykull. Is there a scripture? Mythology? Legends and whatnot?", "answer": "Sure, there’s heaps of that stuff. It evolves across time and space, too. Everyone’s got their own interpretations and uses of a god. ", "tags": []},

{"question": "Are there other deities that you guys worship, or is Shrykull the one supreme god?", "answer": "There are more Mudokon gods than there are Mudokon tribes, but not all of them are practical to Abe.

{"question": "Lior: 1. Some questions about Abe’s possession abilities: How did Abe suddenly become capable of possessing Paramites and Scrabs in AE?", "answer": "Abe’s powers grow over time as he becomes more adept at them.

Oh man, I love that feeling. ", "tags": ["Abe", "Scrab", "Paramite"]},

{"question": "Why can’t he possess some other creatures such as Slogs?", "answer": "Abe can possess Slogs. ", "tags": ["Abe", "Slog"]},

{"question": "Why some creatures explode after being possessed while others don’t?", "answer": "It’s a combination of what Abe wants to happen to them, and the creature’s mental state. Certainly Abe doesn’t want to hurt the innocent, sacred beasts of Oddworld. He usually doesn’t want to go around killing Sligs, but Abe recognizes that needs must. ", "tags": ["Abe", "Slig"]},

I can understand not paying attention to that guy, but you need to listen to your elders, chump! Raisin granted Abe the ability to possess his enemies from afar. No longer does Abe’s chant give him control of whatever the nearest thing to him is, it gives him control over whoever he chooses! ", "tags": ["Abe", "Raisin"]},

Their weapons are designed for their hands, not ours. Sligs might not receive mandatory training but most have spent years handling guns.

{"question": "chant man: why does big face where a mask?", "answer": "On his face. Oh sorry, I misread. He wears a mask because it’s traditional and he’s all about the tradition.

Do they have still their own territories, or were they chased outta the region by nasty imperialist Glukkons?", "answer": "Where they come from is a mystery.

You’d think my momma would have told me, but nooo.", "answer": "I’m sure my momma would have told me if only I’d ever met her. Instead she’s locked up in some chamber somewhere being forced to lay the highest number of Labor Eggs she can manage.

Big Face is a spiritual leader, although by no means the only one. Abe is more of a political-slash-military leader. How can I possibly pick one? I suppose Abe has freed more of us and incited us to fight for our freedom more than Big Face has. Or maybe Big Face accomplished a butt-load before Abe and I were even born. I just don’t know.

{"question": "2.) Why were Intern Shock Rockers cut from the game?", "answer": "Shock Rockers are a fine idea until you realize that your Interns are working in metal environments, with co-workers wearing metal and critter cages that open when a large voltage is delivered to them. Even if those electrified batons saved a few Interns’ lives from escaped Fuzzles getting toothy on their captors, dozens more would be lost to Fuzzle stampedes and accidental electrocutions.

Glukkons and Vykkers are separate industrial families with their own interests. Sometimes that means cooperating, sometimes that means competing.

SpooceShrubs are just one source. SpooceShrubs are, I suppose, comparable to your Earthly mushrooms.

Shrinks are the product of Vykkers AI technicians, completely self-aware machines that take on the responsibilities of corporate negotiation and employee psychologist.

You’ve just described me and Abe and all our buddies, at least at some point in time. I’m not sure what would count as a good Slig. They’re not evil, crikey I’ve laughed alongside them at times, usually when Abe tripped over something. They’re just institutionalized bullies. With bloodlust. And guns.

I was wondering if there are any nice little docile critters that would make good pets. I mean, maybe fuzzles but you can’t forget to feed them O_O.", "answer": "Sure there are more timid and docile creatures, it’s just that they normally run and hide before you can catch a glimpse of them.

Are there really no side effects to this (except obvious, like emotional trauma)?", "answer": "", "tags": ["Abe"]},

{"question": "And secondly, what happens to mudokons while they’re in the Great Beyond?

If you don’t want the horrific sight of cultural cannibalism and ancestral bodysnatching going into your miners’ eyes, you stitch ’em up.

Thank you, come again.", "answer": "There’s no reason at all a promotion should change the personality of its recipient. When Abe “upgrades” his pals from unenthused weaklings to armed fighters, it’s true, he’s giving them the confidence in themselves to stop sitting on their blue butts and start taking a stand against their enemies, but that’s a natural consequence of empowerment, not some artificial personality change delivered by mystic lightning.

The Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot was simply the project we were working on when we stopped all internal game development back in 2005.

The masks are required so that Glukkons can work with Sligs without losing their lunch, and so the Mudokons don’t just die of fright. It’s making my tummy feel weird just thinking about it.

Tragically the Slig tripped up on a SpooceShrub and landed face-first in a nest of angry Fuzzles, who made short work of him. Elum wandered on his own until he came across a Grubb village. They took him in despite their meagre food supply, but were raided by Wolvarks, who kept Elum and made him fight against various wildlife they found. One day when the Wolvarks were on high alert, Elum broke free and ran until he was far away. He sheltered in a cave, but it turned out to be the hive of a Paramite colony. He was about to get eaten by the Paramite Queen when a group of plucky Mudokons came to harvest a bunch of webbing. They rescued Elum and took him to their village, but shortly afterwards Vykkers Labs passed overhead and Elum was abducted by Vykkers, who chopped him up for no reason. The end.

My questions are: What happened to that game that it wwas going to be released for the PS2? And there’s a chance to play that old Beta for PS2?", "answer": "The videos you saw were pre-rendered on PCs, not realtime PS2 footage.

Why did it show up on Oddworld?", "answer": "Hey there moron, good to hear from you. This is either a fantastic coincidence the likes of which speculative fiction has never even contemplated, or we wanted to thank SoBe, who had given us a glut of free publicity in the run-up to Munch’s release.

Why spend Moolah on excursions when it could go towards luxury designer outfits, furniture and blimps? The only guys who benefit are the military equipment manufacturers and Skillya.

I don’t know if thats already been mentioned but a Paramites mouth has an uncanny resemblance to an open hand (with the thumb moved under the four fingers). Would this also have been done to make more of a human connection, rather than the creature looking completely alien.

Before faster forms of transport were created, different races and tribes would have their own languages, but the need for efficient BusinessSpeak weeds out the smaller and more unique dialects. Native races have mostly forgotten their ancient, musical tongues, but just as with other old arts, they’re preserved by wise shamans who recognize the value of cultural knowledge.

Rest, please!” in response to Slig brutality. Abe’s chant was “No! No! No! No!”. Then one day he was so hungry he ate an old Elum Chub he found in a trash can and went on a serious trip.

So my question is, why did everyone have an Abe hype suddenly?", "answer": "Abe’s a pretty popular guy, and can ya blame him? He rescued a whole buncha Mudokons from a life of slavery, including yours truly. No surprise he gets a lotta fan mail, and it’s my job to answer it all! Capisce? Well, I ain’t seen that guy about much lately, so sure. I’m gonna make this an Abe-free week here at Dear Alf Headquarters (aka Alf’s Rehab & Tea). ", "tags": ["Mudokon", "Abe"]},

Sometimes I resort to reading fan mail while making tea. Sometimes that gets messy. Like this one time I poured teabags all over myself! But I was lucky, I know Muds who’ve been through worse. One of my assistants (hey, I gotta sleep too) wasn’t paying attenion one time when she was juggling tea-making with organizing the weekly hackey-sack tournament, and she poured sugar all over her feet! Let this be a warning: pay attention to what you’re doing in the kitchen! I don’t ever want my ingredients wasted again. ", "tags": []},

Were you even allowed to talk to your fellow mudokons when the sligs weren’t around?", "answer": "We got free food and shelter. I mean we had to do our jobs, but at the end of the day everything we needed was provided to us. Everything we thought we needed, I should say. We could talk a bit at work, depending on what the job was and who was supervising, but not much, and it was monitored closely to make sure we were loyal and subserviant to the company.

What’s powering the ropes? Beats me! They go off in loadsa directions and into tiny holes, but if it’s like typical ancient Mudokon technology it’s powered by the flow of wind, water or spiritual energy. ", "tags": ["Mudokon"]},

What did your keyboard pressin’ gods of game development mess up there?? It’s in all versions I played so far (PS1, PC, PS3)! And where’s the patch for that bug in this awesome game? ;)", "answer": "The Magog Sign Company never thought it would be needed. Put it this way: when you’ve got nearly a hundred workers, you might expect a couple to escape. It’s important to know that, so you can recapture or replace them. But you’ve still got nearly a hundred workers! No biggie if that number doesn’t change.

For the better part of a century if they aren’t blown to chunks by glowing ghostly sparkles, a renegade Slig’s bulletspray or the occasional factory obliteration. They certainly don’t live forever. In fact, by the standards of a lot of other Oddworld species, those 80-odd years make for a pretty flash-in-the-pan existence. I guess you have trouble telling how old a Glukkon is because you’re just not used to them.

They were rubbery and fleshy and they oozed a horrible red pus. They used to fly through the air on metal hooks, sometimes dropping down on us poor, unsuspecting workers. It was all very disturbing. Then they’d cocoon themselves in wooden barrels, and when they emerged again they’d transformed into delicious Meech Munchies. It was all worth it in the end.

Pah, you kids today with your limitless sunglasses and more than one sock, you’re barely aware you’re hatched! Why, I’d have given my left arm for a dirty rag to wipe the excess Elum-hoof grease out of the chutes of clogged vendos, but when all you have is a loincloth you’d better be prepared to use that instead. Doesn’t matter if you’ve been toiling in the swelter of the furnace room or wading armpit-deep in Paramite plop, that loincloth is the one thing standing between you and savage indecency, so you stick with it!

We recently announced at the Austrian “Baiting Imagination” Gaming Convention (ABIGCON) that we have already started work on a brand new title called Oddworld: Alf’s Concoction.

He honed his skills of balance and rhythm carrying timed bonepowder kegs in Bonewerkz.

There are male Mudokons (Drones) and female Mudokons (Queens) but we’re neither of them. We use the pronoun ‘he’ because, well, pretty much just because. It’s worth remembering that we’re products of a ‘Civilized’ world that encourages us to slaughter wildlife and topple ecosystems without sparing a thought for the victims.

But you should see the junk food they stash in their bunks! Mudokons don’t get a choice, it’s addictive own-brand or nowt. The real customers are the Khanzumerz in the big cities.

A Paramite Pie is Paramite meat in a pie, with a whole bunch of jelly, salt, preservatives and other things I don’t recommend putting in yourself. They taste good for a bit, but that’s it.

I once lost a stinky job in a meat factory. I was lost in the desert for a whole day at one point. I recently lost the key to one of my store cupboards and the smell seepin’ from there is really startin’ a drive the patrons away. But we gotta learn that these things are lost forever and that we have to adapt. I’ll never get that day back. I’ll never suffer in a factory again. I’m gonna need to buy a lotta air fresheners.

The places y’all have probably been looking for ’em are likely wrong. If the Vykkers or Glukkons have been about, all them Meetle grubs will have been taken away for experiments or repurposing respectively. And if the factories you’re lookin’ at are really just little far-flung Outer Rim underfunded startups by financial noobodies, they ain’t gonna be guarded by Mugs.

Plenty of reasons why. That said, there’s a bunch of really dedicated fans out there who have spent hours of their free time rigging together tools that let you make changes to Abe’s Oddysee and Abe’s Exoddus. Effectively they’ve made a level editor! Go run a few queries on your search engine o’ choince and check it out! Now if we went and released the A.L.I.V.E.

They love drumming up public interest in a topic they can exploit, and boy oh boy is everyone interested in what became of Molluck. The list of people who want to find him alive just to have him shot is longer than Buddy’s belt. But seriously, by the same token how can they not have found him?

{"question": "BigMullock Also If those mudokens can make that storm at the end of Abes oddysee to destroy rupture farms, why don’t they just do that all the time?", "answer": "Because it takes a lotta Spooce! Luckily RuptureFarms is pretty darned close to the Mudokon holy caves of Monsaic Lines, filled with cranky ancient shamans and freaky psychic machines. Multiply by a not small number of rescued Muds all too happy to see their former enslavers electrified, and you’ve got a recipe for the worst weather-related meat factory mishap since Unckie Chunky hisself famously lost 8 thousand tons of Meech Shank to a flash flood. Oh, it can be done with a lot of planning, but an ever-growing proportion of free Muds are too busy celebrating life to give half a care to organizing rebellion.

So if his body’s found and someone kills Abe, he’s a goner—soul in another body or not. Otherwise, anytime he’s about to get 86’d, he could just possess someone near him and just carry on, you know?
