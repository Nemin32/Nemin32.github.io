        <div id = "about">On this site I intend to collect all Dear Alf posts in an easily accessible format (questions and answers only), categorized by tags. The site is currently quite WIP, sometimes the questions leak into the answer and the page only has Dear Alf 1-50 archived. These will be eventually fixed. Until then I hope the site will prove useful to some, who always wanted to binge lore about a specific thing, but found no easy way to do so.</div>
