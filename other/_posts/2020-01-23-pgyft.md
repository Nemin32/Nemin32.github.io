# Dear Alf, Please Get Your Facts Together!

"Dear Alf" was a several years long series of weekly Q&A-s in which
OWI answered some of the fans' questions in an in-universe format.

While some of these can still be accessed over at [Oddworld's
page](https://oddworld.com), a lot can only be accessed at obscure
archives, so I took the task upon myself to gather every single one of
these I can find and put them in a single page, which you can find
below.

Sadly I still can't guarantee that this is every single question and
answer ever given, but it is still the large majority of them.
