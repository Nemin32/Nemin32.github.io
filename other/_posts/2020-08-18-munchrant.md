# Munch on the Operating Table
{:.no_toc}

In this post I intend to try something I haven't tried before, namely a long-form blog-post where I
go over a topic in unnecessarily large depth. And what topic would be better to dissect this way than
Oddworld's perhaps most controversial installation, Munch's Oddysee.

This whole post was inspired by two things, first a
[discussion](https://reddit.com/r/oddworld/comments/i6atqs/whats_with_the_2d_platformer_obsession/)
on Reddit where people talk about their feelings about the series (I especially recommend
[/u/Capt_Baggins'](https://reddit.com/r/oddworld/comments/i6atqs/whats_with_the_2d_platformer_obsession/g0v4rim/)
comment) and second by an argument I had with a friend of whether it is worthwhile to write
long-form about something you don't even like. I was skeptical, but I figured perhaps I'm just
talking without experience, so this post is also an attempt to try myself out at something like
this.

I have received some help while writing this text from a friend, who wishes to remain unnamed; in
the form of a shorter (kind of unfinished) essay, parts of which served as inspiration. I implore
you to read this too, as it gives a short overview of the issues and a different perspective. The
essay can be found [here.](/assets/etc/moessay.txt)

So, settle in and prepare yourself, as this one is a doozy. Enjoy!

## Introduction

Or rather, how I was introduced to Munch (if you're not interested in the backstory, feel free to
jump to the next section), because surprisingly for the longest time I didn't even know Oddworld
wasn't just the two Abe games. My first experiences with the games were at a very young age
(similarly to a [surprising number of people](/imgs/survey/first_played.jpg)) and in sadly less than
legal circumstances, as the disk we had was in fact a pirated copy. But before anyone gets their
panties in a twist, I've since bought the games obviously and perhaps my contributions to the fandom
have re-payed this *horrible travesty.* Why am I bringing this up, you ask?  Well the reason is that
because of the disk not being legit, the cover too was a shoddily cut out piece of paper taped onto
the box; in fact it wasn't even AO's box-art, rather Munch's! So for several years I kept
wondering just who the hell that weird fish-guy could be as you don't meet him anywhere in the
game. However, this of course didn't stop my enjoyment of the game, until I finally had enough and
moved on.

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/munchrant/cover.jpg" description="I have sadly lost the disk since, but this is the exact image that was on it (which also serves as the cover of the game's original Xbox release.)" %}

Things took a turn years later, when for some reason I was browsing the Oddworld wiki, now armed
with a rudimentary knowledge of English (as you might have guessed from my earlier posts or perhaps
my [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp_beYoKiSo), I'm not a native speaker), I suddenly
noticed that there are two more games in the list than I knew about. It's safe to say that I was
terribly excited, I mean, I loved AO and AE, they were basically my favorite games at the time. I
kept binging them and now there is two more? Awesome! --- Or at least that's what I thought at the
time.

Now, I'll be honest: even at the time (we're speaking close to a decade at this point), I wasn't
terribly impressed by what I've seen. Munch looked 'janky' and didn't seem to have the same
atmosphere as the older games did. Because of this and my lack of lunch money that I could waste
on things like this, I soon let go of my interest in both Munch and Stranger; until the time I
rejoined the fandom, many years later. Even then, it took me a good two years of sticking around to
finally give it a go... and oh dear lord it wasn't pretty.

## The Technicalities

I have since been informed several times that the game's PC ports are a mess (though, it's not like
[other versions](https://twitter.com/Stitchlips25/status/1295654548250349568) of the game aren't
bug-ridden); but still this was the way I experienced the game, so this is how I can describe it. I
don't own any (working) consoles - and frankly wouldn't want to give out money just to try a
slightly better version of this game -, so the HD PC version of the game will have to make
do; especially since most of the issues I'll bring up simply stem from the design itself and not
from the atrocious bugs the game is riddled with.

### The Graphics

This one is interestingly the most difficult to properly rate for me in this section, because
despite the game's age and its not exactly smoothest development (more on that later), parts of the
game simply look great. For instance, Abe's model is one that took me by surprise, it looked great
while keeping the character's identity intact. Similarly the Sligs' model too looks faithful and
great.

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/munchrant/abe.jpg" description="Amusingly this render looks much better than how Abe looks like in New 'n' Tasty." %}

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/munchrant/slig.png" description="The same can more or less be said about this Slig model too." %}

But sadly the pretty models aren't impressive enough to fix the glaring issue: the game simply looks
washed out. What I mean by this is that unlike the original two games, which took some heavy
artistic liberties with the palettes and thus were able to give different areas main colors (for
instance, the majority of RuptureFarms is brown, Necrum Mines is blue, Slig Barracks is green and so
on), in Munch everything looks quite samey. Outside areas are all lush green meadows, Industrialist
facilities are all gray concrete jungles; there's no immediate association to the area you're in,
unlike in the Abe games.

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/munchrant/mocomp.jpg" description="Two levels from very different parts of the game, but it's hard to even tell them apart." %}

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/munchrant/aocomp.jpg" description="These two screens alone are way more interesting than basically anything you can find in Munch." %}

This makes the game way less interesting to look at and a lot less memorable. Am I now in Sloghut
1027 or Sloghut 2813? You might be able to tell if you have enough experience in the game, but try
to make the same comparison between any two areas in Oddysee. The only that might fit the bill are
the endgame Zulags, but even those are quite different if you keep an open eye for the backgrounds.

The saddest thing is that the extra dimension 3D provides could have been used to great
effect. We've already seen how imposing Glukkon facilities can be (think RF from the outside of
SoulStorm Brewery), just give us that but in an interactive form. And I'm well aware I'm asking for
a lot, but why even go 3D if it only hurts the game's looks.

### The Sound Design

This one is also somewhat of a mixed bag, but the distinction is quite clear: the music is great,
the sounds otherwise range from "eh, okay" to "simply terrible." Compare for instance the ding that
plays when you complete an objective to the sound Munch makes while moving around on land. The
latter didn't become an ironic meme for no reason and on PC the problem is further exacerbated by
the fact that on some surfaces you become sort of stuck, which causes the sound effect to play 10-15
times in rapid succession, delivering an unexpected ear-bleed to anyone who went in without a clue
(like yours truly).

It is also really off-putting how some of Abe's and the rest of the Mudokons' voice-lines are
directly taken from the old games, which not only means that they sound quite different to the new
lines, but are also way more compressed, making it sound like the character is voiced by two
different people from two different studios. Which is, if you think about it, not an entirely wrong
analogy.

### The Atmosphere and Gameplay

Bit of an odd marriage of two different categories, I know, but I feel like I need to handle them in
one place for things to properly make sense. I think the two are too intertwined to be discussed
separately, so don't be surprised if there are going to be sudden shifts between the topics.

With this disclaimer aside, the best way I can sum up the gameplay of Munch is that it is simply
*mediocre.* There isn't any huge offense the game commits. The controls are solid for the most part
(if a bit affected by the aptly named "2000s jank"), the gameplay has both empowering and
disempowering moments as is tradition in Oddworld games, hell, it even tries to innovate by
introducing new powerups and the controllable machines for Munch, but despite all the attempts, it
just simply doesn't come together organically.

#### Machinery

Let's start with the machinery, because those are the easiest to explain and require the least extra
narration. Basically, they don't really bring anything new to the table. Let's be honest, what's
really the difference between Munch plugging into a machine versus Abe possessing someone? Sure you
need to move the possession orb instead of Munch, but otherwise it's largely presentation. Both let
you take control of something that's originally on the enemy's side and lets you exploit it, before
ditching it. (The fact that Munch's identity is extremely thin will be discussed down the line in
more depth.)

Not only that, but there is usually no threat presented once you've finally reached the
control panel. Cranes are indestructible and Snoozers respawn indefinitely. Compare this to how it
worked in the old game: Yes, there were sections where you could try again as many times as you
wished, but it was also combined with sections that punished you harshly if you messed up.

> "Your Slig died before you cleared up all rooms? Too bad, start over!"

Some might think this is too harsh and players should first and foremost have unadulterated fun and
such punishments only mess up the pacing, but I disagree. While I concur that fun is perhaps the
most important part of the equation, another similarly unavoidable part is the *weight of actions,*
which is sorely missing from Munch. Why'd you care that your Snoozer is under heavy fire? You
obviously don't, if it dies, you just immediately jack into another and continue the action. Imagine
if for example, upon letting Phleg die in Exoddus, simply another spawned and you could continue
where you left off (this is technically already easy to emulate by QuikSaving, but I'm not opening
that can of worms). It'd take all the tension out of an otherwise famously nerve-wracking and
memorable part of the game.

#### Powerups

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/munchrant/vendo.jpg" description="Ah yes, the vending machine, a well-known part of all tribal cultures." %}

Moving on, the powerups are probably the most obvious example of the game's tired design. In the
originals everything had an at least superficially explained reason for existing (other than grenade
machines I suppose, which are worth an argument on their own, but this is about Munch). In Munch,
however, the vending machines simply don't make sense. Not only because it gives fabulous powers to
anyone who consumes them (and yet the Industrialists never use them), but also because even the
Native areas are littered by them. Sure in those places the machines have a much more tribal look to
them, but that just raises extra questions. Did the Mudokons copy them? Did the Industrialists put
them there? Surely not, since the "untainted" parts of the Mudokon world feature them. You might be
rolling your eyes extremely heavily at this point, saying

> "Holy shit man, it's a video game, stop seeing so much into it."

And you know, to a certain extent you have a point. Obviously the reason why these are littered all
around is to give the player tools to solve the levels, but that's not the point of my
argument. Rather that in the previous games, it was (almost) always well-established why things are
put where they are, while here gameplay clashes with the narrative.

To give a more practical example, consider SoulStorm Brew in Exoddus: There it makes a lot of sense
why Glukkon facilities are littered with them. This is how they keep the workforce docile. It is a
vital part of the story, we see how the average Mudokons feel horrible after drinking it, but still
crave more. And as an added piece of brilliance, the Brew became part of the gameplay that the
player can use and abuse against their enemies. Meanwhile in Munch, they're never even really
mentioned, except perhaps once or twice by the Shaman.

I think the issue could have been avoided altogether, if the focus was on these, instead of all
those products the Vykkers made (think BabyChow, Lungbusters, etc.), that serve as little more than
jokes, while not even appearing inside the game at all. Humphrey and Irwin could have bantered a bit
about, how they cause all these wacky side-effects, thus giving these items "legitimacy" in
universe, an easy joke source of how they literally don't care about all these fantastic powers they
grant and a sort of unease for players, knowing that the stuff the characters chug by the gallons
are created by a bunch of cruel bastards, who probably murdered a million cuddly animals to make
these products happen.

#### Leading

Another major tonal shift was the idea, that instead of being a mostly stealth-focused game, Munch's
Oddysee is largely about leading small "strike teams" of Mudokons and Fuzzles into battle and
actively engaging in fights. To reflect this, Abe doesn't die from one hit anymore and in times of
dire need, he can even do a meager slap, that may - in lucky cases - end the life of an already
quite beaten down Slig.

This of course fits into the idea Lorne Lanning has about the progression of the series, characters
go from sole perpetrators, to rebels, to the leaders of full-blown guerrilla forces. However, the
change between the "capabilities" of Mudokons is so without any fanfare, that it just feels
jarring. It's as if suddenly they realized

> "Hey, holy crap, we can use our fists and such."

I'm of course don't expect a long, heart-felt cinematic of how Mudokons finally decide to rise up or
whatever, just a bit of recognition that the fields are slowly getting even. With the Fuzzles this
is of course less of an issue, considering they're a new species, so there aren't any expectations
towards them. Perhaps, this could have been turned into part of the narrative: Through half the
game, the Mudokons are still heavily affected by fear and Brew addiction, so they're incapable of
fighting and thus the scene is all Munch's, but in the latter half of the game it's an all around
fragfest between Mudokons and Fuzzles vs Sligs and Vykkers.

Similarly, the "upgraded" Mudokon versions are just weird. Instead of spears or staffs or anything
similar, the close-combat Muds use comically over-sized clubs. The ranged ones are even weirder, as
we've seen the sort of ranged weapons Mudokons use in Abe's Oddysee in the form of the
slingshot-wielding guardians of the Monsaic Lines. In comparison, Munch's "Mudarchers" wield
"definitely not" machineguns disguised as arm mounted crossbows. Just to be clear, I'm not saying
that Mudokons should use slingshots and only slingshots, variety is great, however it's a sort of
discrepancy in power levels, that their so-called holy sanctum is defended by some lads with a bunch
of pebbles, while they have the technology to rival Slig firepower.

#### Grinding

Even if we put all these plot contrivances aside, it is just kind of disheartening that the old
games' nuanced approach of figuring out your environment, then stealthily navigating through it,
while strategically using your tools is basically all but gone. In Munch's Oddysee the side that has
more strength usually wins...and even that is not exactly true as the odds are heavily stacked in
your favor as you can just respawn the Snoozer or Big Bro you were using or resurrect your fallen
and headbutt the brick-wall until it eventually collapses.

Similarly death became little more than an annoyance. Not only isn't it a game over anymore (as you
can just resurrect Abe with Munch and vice-versa), but also you can just QuikSave whenever you
wish. And once failure becomes meaningless, so does victory. It doesn't take effort, just time.

## The Characters

Similarly to the bleakness I've described in the previous sections, the characters themselves got
quite a few problems too.

### Munch

The eponymous protagonist of the game who hardly feels anything more than a sidekick. I mean
honestly, who even is this guy? We know that he's the last of his species, but does that tell us of
anything? He basically just exists and lets the narrative drag him around. He's either bossed around
by the Raisin or the Fuzzles, having no real agency on his own...in his own game. This took its
toll, as Munch by [my findings](/imgs/survey/favorite_protagonist.jpg) is the least liked
protagonist out of the trio of Abe, him and Stranger.

<div class="showcase">
<a target="_blank" href="/imgs/munchrant/munchconcept1.jpg"><img src="/imgs/munchrant/munchconcept1.jpg"></a>
<a target="_blank" href="/imgs/munchrant/munchconcept2.jpg"><img src="/imgs/munchrant/munchconcept2.jpg"></a>
<a target="_blank" href="/imgs/munchrant/munchconcept3.jpg"><img src="/imgs/munchrant/munchconcept3.jpg"></a>
</div>

Even now as I'm writing this, I'm raking my mind, trying to dig out something relevant to mention,
but I really don't have much. Even fans of the game, who tout how much the love this game don't
really have much to say on Munch's personality based on my experiences.

The weird thing though is that Munch isn't a quickly thrown together character. Based on all the
concept art we've seen over the years, he went over dozens of iterations, maybe hundreds. So the
question arises: Just why the hell is this guy so bland?

To be entirely correct, we do know that parts of his storyline and character were axed
altogether. For instance, the well-known story of how Munch would have had received an aggressive
steroid therapy from the Vykkers, which caused him to sometimes turn into a Hulk-like being upon
being irritated enough. Another idea was that Munch would be a tapeworm, whom Abe could swallow and
carry around, then regurgitate whenever necessary.

While I'm well aware, that this rapid iterating is how OWI usually does things, the amount of it
done still sort of implies to me, that perhaps they had no real idea of what to do with the
character. Sadly the end result of this indecisiveness ended up as a hollow shell, that exists, is
good for marketing, but otherwise has no personality at all.

### Abe

Well...he exists. He doesn't undergo any particularly huge changes in personality between
Oddysee/Exoddus and this game. This perhaps might not seem like a huge deal, considering this is
Munch's game after all, but I think that's not a good approach. Characters really shouldn't "just
exist," yet Abe is doing just that. Just like in Oddysee and Exoddus, he's still the same schmuck
who gets bossed around, the only difference being that this time it is the Raisin who tells him to
do stuff. If anything we should have seen the beginnings of Abe's transformation of a survivor into
a leader. It'd even fit the game well, considering Mudokons are now willing to fight for him.

However, all we get is a small fourth-wall break from him at the end of the game, when he says

> **Abe:** "You know, most of the time, when I leave a mean place like that, it blows up."

The joke isn't lost on me, but I'd argue the chuckle it might induce in the audience is traded for a
blow to the seriousness of the series. Don't get me wrong, Oddworld was never a terribly serious
series, but while it always provided ways to laugh with the game, the game never made fun of itself.

#### A Quick Aside

I have mentioned both in Munch's and Abe's case that they're being bossed around by higher powers
and fate too and some would probably consider this a deliberate narrative choice, showing how these
well-intentioned but naive characters keep being used by others as pawns. I have no problem with
this, I like it, it's oddworldian, the problem rather is that the characters don't mature at
all. Abe in Abe's Oddysee could be freely swapped to Abe in Munch's Oddysee and basically nothing
would change.

It'd make for an even more compelling narrative to see these characters realize that they're being
played by others and subtly subverting their control, until the whole thing turns into a war on
three fronts. Or perhaps, to keep up the bleak atmosphere, Abe and the rest of protagonists could
try again and again to break free, only to realize that they actually fulfilled some scheme all
along.

I understand, that Oddworld is much more a story about the world itself and less about the
individuals, but still, they don't exist in a vacuum, the story should reflect that.

### Lulu

Despite all, I consider Lulu the most likable character of the entire game and I'm genuinely unsure
whether that's a good thing. Ironically, despite being the least active member of the cast, he
undergoes the most "character development" by undergoing a rags-to-riches then a riches-to-rags
moment. Obviously he wouldn't fare well as a main character, but as a half-joke/half-plot device, he
works well.

The only thing I find lacking in him is a bit of extra characterization. We hardly get to know the
guy, as he basically spends the whole game sleeping. How did he even get all those donation booths?
And how did every Glukkon get one? Question I don't think even Lanning knows the answer to.

### The Almighty Raisin

I hate this character and I hate the fact that I have to hate him. Here's someone who canonically
existed for potentially thousands of years, so could lay some heavy story beats for us to broaden
our perspective on the world...and what do we get? A senile old guy, who is nonetheless revered by
the Mudokons.

Those who might have no idea, the Raisin has a backstory. He used to be this ancient tree, who upon
sensing danger shed it's original form to become a being that can communicate and forewarn a huge
catastrophe. Of course the game won't tell you this, you need to dig into promotional material and
whatnot. Point is, the existence of this character is more or less a big middle finger to any fan
who perhaps hoped to hear a bit more about the world.

Not only this, he's basically a thinly veiled plot device, instead of events naturally reaching the
protagonists (by defectors or catching a rebel broadcast or maybe reading the Daily Deception or any
sort of way), he just straight up tells Abe and Munch

> "Hey, go here and here for plot reasons."

It just keeps a choke-hold on the world. Any of the aforementioned ways would have let us peer a bit
into the cultures and groups, but no, we need a character that just readily gives away info, why
even bother.

### The Shaman

What the BigFace did elegantly and without a word (except in the bad ending I guess, but that hardly
takes away from the point), this clown does with several forced jokes and hand-holding. Imagine if
on every few screens in Abe's Oddysee, the BigFace would pop up saying something like,

> "Sup Abe, you need to use your acrobatic skills and traverse some obstacles. Don't forget your
> possession ability either!"

It'd be horrible! And yet in a game like this that has huge areas that yawn with emptiness, a
literal guide is necessary so the players don't feel that lost. His presence also takes away from
Abe's character, who got around pretty well with minimal direct guidance before, now he's apparently
an idiot, who literally needs to be spoon fed how to get around.

His demeanor caused him to become sort of a meme in the more hard-line parts of the fanbase,
especially his catchphrase that he utters whenever you make him shut up:

> *"No respect!"*

### Humphrey and Irwin

They're a mixed bag. On one hand, unlike Exoddus' three stooges, they are actually menacing
villains, while also cracking some not-terrible jokes and they caused quite a few people to sleep
unwell who experienced the bad ending. On the other hand, for nearly half of the story they simply
screw off and don't even appear for a second.

To be frank, Munch isn't guilty alone with this issue. In Abe's Oddysee, Molluck too sort of forgot
to appear for three quarters of the game, but similarly to this horror-duo his presentation was
strong enough to carry it through the game. However, while this is justifiable in Molluck's case as
he was the villain of the very first game, I think Munch's Oddysee could have went one step further,
if only to further exemplify just what Abe and Munch are fighting against.

### The Rest of the Characters

Munch's Oddysee started the annoying trend of chatty characters, who simply have to make their
presence known every five seconds or so. On one hand the system is a semi-elegant way of letting the
player use one of their senses naturally to locate elements of gameplay (instead of something 
immersion-breaking like an outline to characters that you can see through walls or similar.) On the
other, however, there simply aren't enough lines for the characters to keep the concept fresh and
quickly you'll start recognizing the half-dozen legible and few completely gibberish lines the
characters idly mutter to themselves and to each other.

The fact that every single character are carbon copies of each other can be noted as a problem, as
the Xbox's stronger hardware surely would have allowed a few different models, but honestly, this is
least concerning, the previous games had only one variation of each character, so it's not that big
of a deal.

I think the voice problem would have been way less noticeable if either characters spoke much more
rarely, they had way more voice lines or perhaps if they had special voice lines that played
whenever something happened on the level, which would also increase immersion.

As for the Fuzzles and Interns, who both only speak gibberish, I guess the problem doesn't really
apply. I liked the design of the latter, since being a bunch of goalless workers, who are so
uninterested in life that working with their mouths sewn shut is okay for them is a pretty gruesome
concept. Fuzzles on the other hand are still perhaps one of the most boring creature designs in
Oddworld, second only to the Stranger's Wrath's overgrown chickens, the Clakkerz.

## The Humor

> **Slig:** "Ayy, buttwipe!"

Now, I feel like I have to preface this: humor is extremely subjective, so while the whole writing
is largely an opinion piece, this part is even more so. Still, it is an important part of my review,
so I can't leave it out. I will write in a tone that presents my opinion as if they were facts,
because it's both easier to write and more pleasant to read, but I obviously recognize that they
aren't. So yeah, in this section just imagine the words "in my opinion" into any and every sentence
you read.

Munch's Oddysee is simply too crass to be funny to me.

I adore the older games' humor. Abe stumbling around, being a complete klutz, the overreactions of
the Glukkons, the Newscaster Slig, it's all good fun. While it isn't particularly nuanced, it is
miles better than the absolute toilet-humor Munch presents. Most of the jokes that the characters
make are on the level of calling others crap or similar, like the only wants to appeal to an
audience made up of 12-13 years olds. This is also painful in another way, as it completely takes
off the edge of some characters who used to be absolutely menacing. Think about Sligs for instance,
while in Exoddus they served as comic relief in cutscenes, in-game there was no joking around, they
still beat the slaves and shot you without wisecracking.

For another, more hands on example, let's take possessing Glukkons in Exoddus and Munch: In the
former, it is both an empowering moment of finally bossing others around, with the whole
establishment suddenly becoming your ally and also an implicit source of jokes as while the Glukkons
walk you can faintly hear the sound of a xylophone and whenever they accidentally hit a wall, they
just flop and then stand up with a deliciously contemptuous grunt. Also whenever you possess a head
Glukkon, they have a bunch of amusing lines that became memes in the fandom, whether it's "that blue
bastard" or "Dripik! I knew that!" these lines gave these otherwise rarely appearing characters
lovable personalities. In Munch, however, they basically became "timewasters," all of them are
locked inside tiny rooms, where the only thing you can do with them is to dish out some cash for
Lulu. It's nothing different than pushing a button. The lines they utter after losing their fortune
are also very generic and have way less of an impact, because why'd you even care about these
characters?

Even in presentation the game is lying way too heavily on trying to be funny, which ultimately
caused it to fall on its face for me. The comically sped up animations, Abe curling into a ball
every time he jumps, herding one eyed sheep... The whole thing just feels like OWI wants to say
something like this,

> "Hey kid, remember the originals? They were dark and moody, right? Well dont'cha worry, this one
> is full of fun and youthful energy!"

And no, the disturbing ending doesn't provide enough counterweight, when the game is otherwise so
full of silliness.

## Issues around Development

Not only did the game have a very ambitious scope, it was also struck by several unlucky (and in
some cases perhaps malicious) events surrounding its development. Here you can read some of these:

### The PS2-Xbox Switcheroo

If you are old enough, you might remember this, hell, perhaps you're one of the unfortunates, who
fell victim to this. Through most of its marketing cycle Munch's Oddysee was heavily pushed as a PS2
launch title and several pieces of media wrote about it as such. I've spoken with multiple people,
who in anticipation of the game bought a PS2 from their saved up cash...only to be severely
disappointed, when OWI sneakily struck a deal with Microsoft and turned Munch into an Xbox title.

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/munchrant/pennyarcade.jpg" description="<a href='https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2000/10/23'>Penny Arcade</a> is well known for their comics that satirized OWI's overly financial-oriented choices." %}

Now, financial-wise this was an excellent move for OWI. They got basically limitless funding from
the tech giant and also the chance to develop for the stronger platform of the Xbox. However, it
both caused much harm to the fans, who felt like they were cheated (especially the ones mentioned
above) and caused development to become somewhat disoriented.

Whether OWI had to start from scratch because of the platform-change is an interesting
question. While many people claim that they had to start again from zero, it is actually entirely
possible that they were able to port a part of their already existing work, as it turns out Munch's
Oddysee ran on the Gamebryo engine (also known as NetImmerse, the same engine that powered
Morrowind, Fallout 3 and [a bunch of other games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebryo)), which
was in fact made with cross-platform deployments in mind, meaning it could be used to create games
for both the PS2 and the Xbox.

The very late switch-up also caused OWI to need to take some really desperate measures, including
firing most of the development team in exchange for a few new developers, who rewrote a large part
of the game, just months before the release date.

Amusingly the same platform-change was later pulled off with Stranger's Wrath again, but that's a

One thing is for certain, while Microsoft has a lot of blood on their hands, the failure of Munch
wasn't their fault. If anything, they provided the means for the game to become reality in the first
place, thus blaming them is misplaced anger.

### "False Advertising"

I'm putting the title in quotes as technically there is no way to prove that this was in fact the
goal, however, based on what Lorne Lanning said, it's hard not to consider them as such. I'm of
course talking about the so-called "visualizations." What are these? I'll refer you to a quote from
an article:

> **[Game of X](https://magogonthemarch.wordpress.com/game-of-x-v-1-xbox-2018/):** Lanning performed
> what he called “a jujitsu.” From his days working in the aerospace industry, he remembered that
> they often created “visualizations” of future products. So what Lanning did is have his crew
> pre-render game scenes from Munch. Because these scenes were not rendered in the PS2 devkit, but
> were simply “visualizations” of their product, it was perfectly legal for them to share them,
> which they did. They made about a hundred CDs with these game visualizations and sent them to
> major media contacts. They said, ‘Hey, look at what we're working on. Here's the movie
> clips. Here's screenshots. Here's the story about Munch's Oddysee.”

As written above, these were animated scenes that were all but presented as actual gameplay
footage. There are still many of these floating around on Youtube, some calling them "betas," some
cut content, but in fact they were nothing more than OWI saying "this is what we wish Munch to be."

This of course didn't help in tempering expectations and only serve as a testament of all the
promises this game left unfulfilled.

### Cut Content

Perhaps the most hurtful part of the entire ordeal. If you spend some time reading what sort of
stuff [Lorne Lanning said about the
game](https://magogonthemarch.wordpress.com/status-and-power-oddworld-isnt-so-odd-anymore/) before
its release, you'd probably get quite a different idea than what ultimately became of Munch. 

Below you can read some examples. They're pretty nice as ideas, but let's be honest, half of this
stuff couldn't even be accomplished even with today's tech without major compromises or
simplifications.

#### Wealth / Status

In this hypothetical version of Munch, all characters stand somewhere on the social ladder. If you
possess a nobody, then you probably won't achieve much as the poor guy won't be taken seriously. To
circumvent this you could either possess someone with more wealth and status or take out a hefty
loan, thus give the impression that your character is way richer than they really are. This gives
you access to new areas and lets you boss around people under you.

While money in a really minimal way does appear in the game (think of the Lulu donation machines and
how it drains Glukkons), this status system was completely axed.

#### Terraformation

Depending on the choices you took in the game (which will be discussed in the next section), the
terrain would dynamically change to reflect how environmentally responsible you were. This means
that eventually the levels would either become desolate landscapes or lush, thriving grooves.

This too was completely axed as a consequence of the following feature being cut.

#### Multiple solutions

While it is true, that you have some options (like whether you want to save the Mudokons and Fuzzles
or not), the way this was originally described is that each level would have had several solutions,
some helping the world, some ailing it. Players would have had the agency to decide whether they
want to take the easy but destructive path or the more challenging route that needs some
out-of-the-box thinking, but in return steer themselves towards the better ending.

#### Munch the Beastmaster

Another scrapped content was the idea that Munch would have been able to tame different
sorts of wildlife, who could help him solve his troubles.

</div>

> [PlayStation Magazine UK](https://magogonthemarch.wordpress.com/official-uk-playstation-magazine-the-munch-bunch-2000/):
> "Just as Abe possesses living creatures, Munch possesses mechanical devices to rescue animals from
> traps, setting them free, then leading them to places where he can nurture them into bigger and
> better things that he can then use to his advantage.”

While this is obviously cut, some vestigial remains of this concept still exists in the game in the
form of Munch being the only creature who can understand the Fuzzles as their speech is gibberish to Abe.

#### "Smarter" GameSpeak

> [PlayStation Magazine UK](https://magogonthemarch.wordpress.com/official-uk-playstation-magazine-monster-munch-1999/):
> "Obviously communicating with these creatures will require a vocabulary slightly more sophisticated
> than the phrases and farts of the Abe games. How this will be achieved on what is essentially the
> same joypad is anybody's guess, but Lorne claims that, 'Gamespeak will become much more highly
> evolved and smarter, but also much simpler to understand and use.'"

I don't think this requires much explanation, unless he literally meant that instead of one line for
each GameSpeak, there is now three or four; MO's GameSpeak is basically the same as in the older
games, albeit with even less things to say.

## Aftermath

> **G-Man, Half Life 2:** "So, wake up Mr. Freeman... Wake up and smell the ashes."

While Munch sold relatively well and found its audience in the fandom, some even considering the
game their favorite, the professional reception of the game was a much more mixed bag compared to
the universal acclaim the originals received. It also caused Microsoft to go back on the three game
publishing deal they struck with OWI, leaving them to look for a new partner, whom they ultimately
found in EA... And we know how that ended.

> [Contemporary blog-post about Oddworld](http://www.fourhman.com/blog/archive/2005/04/the-final-oddworld-lornes-exoddus.html):
> "Then, before the Xbox launch, Lanning goes on the PR circuit to declare that the Xbox will be the
> exclusive home of his Oddworld games because only the Xbox is powerful enough to handle his
> vision. His vision being an item-collecting mascot platformer. Oh yeah, no other system could
> possibly handle something as complex as that. The game, Oddworld - Munch's Oddysee, is touted as
> one of the major players in the Xbox's original lineup, but no one buys it. Oddworld is
> effectively DOA."

One memorable review describes Munch as a "great game, but it's a little long":

One can say without much hesitation that Munch's overly ambitious goals and yet less than stellar
delivery practically set up OWI for its closure after Stranger's Wrath's release, as the company got
a nasty mark on its prestige which barred them from partnering with more supportive companies. This
is why saying that EA killed Oddworld is short-sighted I think. Their lack of marketing might have
delivered the final blow, but OWI by then was already pretty bleeding heavily from a self-inflicted
gunshot in the foot.

## Conclusion

Well, we're almost 6000 words in; so if you've reached this far, congratulations! While it might
seem that I'm very harsh on this game, that really isn't the intention. I'm just trying to hold it
to the same standards as the old ones. To summarize the problem with Munch, it simply wasn't
different enough to be interesting, nor samey enough to capitalize on nostalgia and the
tried-and-true methods of Oddysee and Exoddus.

Munch today lives on as a niche-inside-a-niche, considering Oddworld isn't as much of a household
name as it used to be. My queries into the fandom decisively put it the second least liked Oddworld
game just after New 'n' Tasty.

OWI too made it quite clear that Munch is more or less a sunken ship. While they don't mind
re-releasing it every once in a while on new platforms (it's free money, yo), Soulstorm effectively
retcons Munch's Oddysee leaving the character in the abyss between the canon and the obsolete
lore. Apparently Lanning still considers Munch a character that's part of the universe, but every
other circumstance is up in the air...and frankly maybe that's for the better.
