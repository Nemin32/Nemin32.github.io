# State of the Fandom

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/stateofthefandom/mom.png" description="\"Top management reports
everything's gonna be fine! ... Uh-huh.\"" %}

Happy belated new year! Now that the _Enahnced Edition_ of _Soulstorm_ had been released, it's a bit
of a slow-season when it comes to _Oddworld_-content. With that in mind, I'd like to take the
opportunity to make a small tally about how each individual community of the fanbase is holding up.

## Social Media

Of course first and foremost we should take a look at the OWI's main social media sites. While I'll
comment individually on the changes, you can regardless see my last set of measurements
[here.](/activity) Remember to click on the images to see them in full-size.

### Facebook

<div class="floater" markdown=1>

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/stateofthefandom/facebook.png" description="Consistent like-bleeding." %}

The Facebook-page has long been the [sick man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sick_man_of_Europe) of
OWI's platforms. Despite its occasional resurgences, long-term projections have shown time and time
again that it'll always begin bleeding followers and likes rapidly.

Compared to last time, when the page had 155.096 likes, 168.101 is a far nicer number, however, as
the trendline shows, it is unlikely to stay this high if things continue similarly.

### Twitter

<div class="floater" markdown=1>

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/stateofthefandom/twitter.png" description="Despite the many
negative days, the net sum is still in the positives." %}

As can be seen from the graphs below, the Twitter has basically stabilized. There have been no
outlying gains nor losses in the last few months, causing the page to hover at around 43.000
followers for close to half a year now.

At the previous measurement the site had 37.375 followers. Now it has 43.042. As mentioned before,
things seem to have completely stabilized.

</div>

### Instagram

<div class="floater" markdown=1>

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/stateofthefandom/insta.png" description="The positives and
negatives largely balance themselves out." %}

Arguably the Instagram's situation is almost exactly the same as the Twitter's as its follower-count
has been floating around 19.000 for the last six months. Unlike the Twitter, however, the Instagram
does display an extremely slow growth (10-20 additional followers / month.)

Previously the page had 18.910 followers, now it has 19.029. It can be considered an absolutely
miniscule growth considering the timeframe.

</div>

### YouTube

<div class="floater" markdown=1>

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/stateofthefandom/youtube.png" description="Not much to see..." %}

Just like previously, I don't have much to say about the Youtube page. It seems to be gaining about
30.000 views / month, which is about ten thousand views more than the last time I measured, and
experiences a very slow growth.

Last time it had 25.500 subscribers, now it has 25.600.

</div>

## Communities

Next let's have a look at the more discussion-oriented platforms.

### Reddit

While of course the click-count since initial spike has greatly diminished, it can still be said
that the average monthly viewing rate of [/r/Oddworld](https://reddit.com/r/Oddworld) has increased
from about 5.000 to just below 10.000.

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/stateofthefandom/reddit.png" description="" %}

Interestingly, unlike most of the official platforms, the release of the _Extended Edition_ seemed
to affect the site somewhat, as there is a slight bump in the click-count at around November.

Of course I don't have any hard data, but from personal experience, posts seem to either gather 1-2
or up to 30-70 comments on them, depending on the topic's divisiveness. Upvote counts generally move
on the below-100 scale.

### Discord

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/stateofthefandom/messages_merged.png" description="Daily census,
blue = #soulstorm, green = #chat, purple = every other channel combined." %}

As can be seen from both graphs, the server faced an unprecedented slow-season around August, which
lasted until the middle of November, when the _Enhanced Edition_ was released, which brought in some
new members and reignited discussions for a while.

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/stateofthefandom/messages_merged_average.png" description="Five
day running average." %}

Whether this activity will stay remains to be seen, however, the short term trend seems to be
downwards pointing. One thing's clear, however, conversations seem to have almost entirely moved
away from discussing *Soulstorm* and rather focus either on the art posted in the server's related
channel, off-topic discussions, or what if-s. 

## Miscellaneous

Some other stuff that doesn't belong anywhere else.

### The Acoustic Panels

{% include caption.html url="/imgs/stateofthefandom/dunno.png" description="" %}

The number sold is still only 24 out of 500, as was half a year ago. Seems like they aren't as
popular as OWI might have thought they'll be. On the other hand, I guess this makes that two-dozens
all the rarer.

### Preferences based on OWI's query

Before we wraps thing up I'd like to present one more interesting statistic, namely which game
people named as their favorite on OWI's Twitter. At the time of writing the
[tweet](https://twitter.com/OddworldInc/status/1480607373316214786) received about 165 replies, some
of which couldn't be counted due to not containing clear answers. In instances where someone named
multiple games, I counted each as a vote for that particular game to avoid introducing my own bias.

Without further ado, here are the results:

| Nr. |       Game       | Number of votes | Percentage of Votes |
| :-- | :--------------: | --------------: | ------------------: |
| 1.  |  Abe's Exoddus   |              77 |                 45% |
| 2.  |  Abe's Oddysee   |              25 |               14.8% |
| 3.  | Stranger's Wrath |              24 |               14.2% |
| 4.  | Munch's Oddysee  |              22 |                 13% |
| 5.  |  New 'n' Tasty   |              15 |                8.9% |
| 6.  |    Soulstorm     |               6 |                3.6% |
| === |       ===        |             === |                 === |
| -   |     In total     |             169 |                100% |

(Oddworld Adventures, Oddworld Adventures II, The Hand of Odd, and Sligstorm have received one vote
each as well.)

    table, th, td {
        border: 1px solid var(--font-color);
    }

    th {
        background: var(--header-bg);
        color: white;
    }

    th, td {
        padding: 0.5rem;
    }
</style>

As one can see [time](/newsurvey) and [time](/swgiveaway) (and [time](/survey)) again, Exoddus still
reigns supreme, followed by the others in almost always the same order. Soulstorm seems to have
failed to budge the original's status as the most beloved installation in the series.

## The All-in-All

As one can see 2022 is off to a somewhat perilous start for OWI, at least when it comes to social
media engagement. While few platforms are outright bleeding users, (looking at the Facebook,) they
are regardless either stagnating or experiencing almost insignificant growth.

The question arises: **What next?** The *Enchanced Edition's* release, while probably great for sales,
did little to bring in many new people. This can be heavily felt in just how slow the communities
feel.

And considering the speed at which OWI releases games, it seems like we might be looking forward to
another couple years of little content and a hibernating fanbase. That is, of course, if OWI is even
capable of (or willing to) release another game.

Either way, things seem to be slowly petering out.
