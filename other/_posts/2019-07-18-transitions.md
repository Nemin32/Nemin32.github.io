      <p class="msg">Fleeing deeper into the grinding lines than ever before, <br> but not long ago Abe was just waxing floors!</p>

      <p class="msg">The smell of searing flesh was nothing like the sweet, <br> familiar aroma of his favorite Tasty Treats.</p>

      <p class="msg">The trains take him elsewhere, but back he will be. <br>  They won't go too far, and there's not much to see.</p>

      <p class="msg">Furnace and grinders still hot in his mind, <br> Abe frantically flees from the farm's fleshy grind.</p>

      <p class="msg">The Natives were wary of a factory-born face, <br> but Abe was in awe of this spiritual place.</p>

      <p class="msg">More Flint Locks remain in the Mudokon shrines. <br>  To light them all, Abe must leave the Monsaic Lines.</p>

      <p class="msg">A world unknown but now uncovered; <br> hauntingly familiar, with much more to be discovered.</p>

      <p class="msg">Out of the forest, the Elum appeared. <br>  The journey to the temple was becoming weird.</p>

      <p class="msg">The Elum was strong and made travelling easy. <br>  But riding on its back left Abe feeling queasy...</p>

      <p class="msg">With Slig patrols conquered and Natives appeased, <br> the duo tore onwards (and far from the bees).</p>

      <p class="msg">To the temple, Abe now travelled. <br>  What dark mysteries would be unravelled?</p>

      <p class="msg">The Elum was quick, and its jumps had great power. <br>  Abe would soon be at the great wooden tower.</p>

      <p class="msg">Abe had eaten Paramite Pies and suffered much illing, <br> yet now he faces more than just processed pastry filling.</p>

      <p class="msg">Abe's soon to learn how formidable his favorite "pies" can be.  <br> Help him survive - help him to see.</p>

      <p class="msg">Harsh lessons of Paramites would  soon sear his flesh.  <br> Now he wonders how he got into this mess.</p>

      <p class="msg">Abe returns, having travelled so far, <br> his right hand branded with the Paramite scar.</p>

      <p class="msg">Scrabanian canyons stretched deep and wide, <br> but they'd be no problem with an Elum to ride!</p>

      <p class="msg">The Elum crossed wild terrain with ease, <br> but the Natives ahead were yet to be pleased...</p>

      <p class="msg">Abe's quest for the temple took him to great heights, <br> but he wouldn't give up on the Mudokons' plight.</p>

      <p class="msg">The greatest threat to Abe's persistence <br> was the temple looming in the distance.</p>

      <p class="msg">Vast distances covered and Slig patrols bested. <br>  Now Abe approached the temple where the Scrabs nested...</p>

      <p class="msg">Many have failed the Scrabs' tests ahead, <br> but never one such as Abe, whose people must be led.</p>

      <p class="msg">Challenging Scrabs is no cake walk, Abe found. <br>  Most vicious and deadly when not chopped up and ground.</p>

      <p class="msg">Something more Abe becomes, though he's yet to understand. <br>  A scar still awaits his unmarked hand.</p>

      <p class="msg">The wells bring Abe back from the sun-bleached sand, <br> Scrab scar etched on the back of his left hand.</p>

      <p class="msg">Back to the farm, the home of Abe's life. <br>  Now to bring it all down, and unleash his soul strife.</p>

      <p class="msg">Approaching the end, but for Abe or the farm? <br>  Only you can determine, which shall receive more harm.</p>

      <p class="msg">Security's tight, but Abe's in for the fight. <br>  To be victorious you must demonstrate his might.</p>

      <p class="msg">After such a journey, Abe's friends will appear. <br>  To aid in his battle they'll not let him fear.</p>

      <p class="msg">Mud souls still at work, unaware of their fate. <br>  More still to rescue, before its too late.</p>

      <p class="msg">A shortcut...</p>

      <p class="msg">Places unseen, decrepit and bare. <br>  Soon no Mudokons should be slaving there.</p>

      <p class="msg">More Mudokons await, their lives in great peril. <br>  Rescue them quick or see their bones in a barrel.</p>

      <p class="msg">Security increasing, defenses alarmed. <br>  Sligs gather in hordes and very well armed.</p>

      <p class="msg">Only a few Mudokons left, not many remained. <br>  Lead them to Shrykull portals, and unleash Abe's reign.</p>

      <p class="msg">Towards the heavily-guarded power generator, Abe must go. <br>  If he shuts it all down, it will be quite the show.</p>

      <p class="msg">A horrifying realization, experienced near. <br>  Fate's brought Abe's return - now there's no time for fear.</p>

      <p class="msg">Try throwing grenades or bottlecaps while Abe is crouched, <br> and while standing. Spot the difference!</p>

      <p class="msg">Even while rolling, Abe can launch into the air or slow right <br> down to a quiet shuffle. A multi-talented Mudokon!</p>

      <p class="msg">Don't hold a grenade in your paw for too long, <br> or you'll become Mudokon mincemeat!</p>

      <p class="msg">Freeing slaves through bird portals releases healing birds; <br> help your fellow Mudokons and they'll help you!</p>

      <p class="msg">Maintenance is hard work in a place as big as RuptureFarms. Good thing <br> there are matching lights on levers, trapdoors, meat grinders and more!</p>

      <p class="msg">Jump up while standing underneath a ledge to climb straight up; <br> useful in those confined spaces!</p>

      <p class="msg">Hop to it! Jump while standing still for a short, controlled hop <br> or jump while running for a longer leap.</p>

      <p class="msg">Looking for someone? All workers are listed in RuptureFarms <br> directories</p>

      <p class="msg">Scrubbing floors isn't so great for Mudokon cardio, so don't be <br> surprised if fellow escapees refuse to copy your daring leaps and climbs!</p>

      <p class="msg">A healthy Mudokon travels with a full halo of birds. <br>  Press #HAL# to check your health; the more the merrier!</p>

      <p class="msg">With a quick tap of #THR# you can drop bottlecaps and more <br> while on the run; faster than a carefully-aimed throw!</p>

      <p class="msg">No single Mudokon has seen all of RuptureFarms; who knows <br> what secrets lie beyond concealed entrances and trapdoors...?</p>

      <p class="msg">The more Mudokons you rescue, the more opportunities you'll have <br> to unleash Shrykull's power!</p>

      <p class="msg">Mudokon slaves learn to obey orders the hard way, so when a Slig <br> yells "Freeze!" the wise Mudokon hits the deck. </p>

      <p class="msg">Sligs may be short-sighted and short on brain cells, but they know <br> suspicious behaviour when they see it.</p>

      <p class="msg">Watch out! Motion Detectors can cut off mystical energy. Set one off and <br> you'll lose your Shrykull power in the blink of an eye!</p>

      <p class="msg">Sligs can hold the trigger for a pretty long time, but sooner or later <br> they'll need to back up and adjust their aim.</p>

      <p class="msg">You don't always have to carefully aim your grenades; try throwing <br> without aiming to drop a surprise on the spot!</p>

      <p class="msg">The trains to other Zulags are controlled by security locks. <br>  Find all the levers to gain access to the next station.</p>

      <p class="msg">Hungry Slogs will bite the hand that feeds them, so you'd better <br> make sure it's holding a loaded gun.</p>

      <p class="msg">Chant Suppressors are hard on disobedience, but not hard enough to <br> withstand a well-timed grenade.</p>

      <h2>Alf</h2>

      <p>The following messages are from the DLC, Alf's Escape.</p>

      <p class="msg">Sligs make the lousiest customers <br> Lead Alf to greener pastures!</p>

      <p class="msg">Alf can travel down through Dreg Chutes. Just find <br> the right lever to operate the trapdoor!</p>

      <p class="msg">Friends don't let friends become food <br> Keep Alf alive at all costs!!</p>

      <p class="msg">Friends are for life, not just for lunchtime <br> Don't let Alf come to any harm!!</p>

      <p class="msg">Annexed away and brewing strange flavours <br> A lost soul named Alf, in need of a saviour.</p>

      <p class="msg">The slaughterhouse sang with awful howls, <br> and they echoed through Abe, right down to his bowels.</p>

      <p class="msg">Abe's nerves had been shaken so far, <br> but he persevered onwards to find Alf and his bar.</p>

      <p class="msg">Avoiding a fate as mashed Slog food, <br> Abe smelled strange beverages being brewed</p>

      <p class="msg">The dreg chutes had many outlets below. <br>  Abe headed for freedom, with Alf now in tow!</p>

      <p class="msg">Alf would soon be rescued too, <br> but was still to concoct his last brew</p>
