# Dear Alf, Please Get Your Facts Together!

"Dear Alf" was a several years long series of weekly Q&A-s in which
OWI answered some of the fans' questions in an in-universe format.

While some of these can still be accessed over at [Oddworld's
page](https://oddworld.com), a lot can only be accessed at obscure
archives, so I took the task upon myself to gather every single one of
these I can find and put them in a single page, which you can find
below.

Sadly I still can't guarantee that this is every single question and
answer ever given, but it is still the large majority of them.

So, what are you waiting for? Pick a post from the list below or use your
browser's search function to find more out about a topic that interests you!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox are all great systems with
terrific games. It's not about one being "bad" and the other "rules".  
It's about choices, like t.v.'s, computers ,or cars! We live in a world
of CHOICES!  
Oddworld chose to go with the Xbox because we are a first party game
with them. MS and Xbox offers an incredible amount of technical support.
It's hard for you fans to understand how difficult it is to make a game.
OK I said my peace.  
Stay odd. Alf

That's a Glukkon in the gamescreen. It's not Molluck but more like a Jr.

You can possess Glukkons but I can't tell ya anymore right now. Stay

<p><b>Alf:</b> Hiya:  
The pics you are referring to are production art for Munch's Oddysee.
Many of these images and concepts did not make the cut. Final game does
not include many of the the "Status" images.  
Look for these to show up in Munch's Exoddus.

<p><b>Alf:</b> Dear Sydney,  
You have been a wonderful fan and we at Oddworld loved Oddworldian.net  
It was well written and produced with a lot of class. I will truly miss
your site. You are the kind of fan a franchise can only dream of having.
Oddworldian.net will go into the hall of fame of Oddworld fansites.  
I'm sorry you lost interest in Oddworld. It's been a hard journey for us
and especially our fans. The reality of business is difficult. Oddworld
is a young company and we are learning. It breaks my heart that you have
lost interest. It was a pleasure Sydney. Best of luck to you. You are a
fine young man. It's been a blast, keep in touch!

<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> That's right Abe Babe!

The group Music Instructor was not responsible for this new single. The
producer for Get Freaky also produced "Use Yur Imagination" with E-Pac
and featured artist Jean Beauvoir in Germany. (check out
www.jeanbeauvoir.com )

We can't post the entire video because it just came out but I can tell
you that it's 100% OWI cg.

Maybe fans can write in and request "Use Yur Imagination".

Hey, Xavier...let us know if you see it!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> This production design image is one of the first sketches done
of Glukkons. The image of the Glukkon on the right is a Glukkon without
it's big suit on. Remember Molluck in the good ending of A.O.  
Don't read too much into the small costumed Glukkon. This is just a
exploratory piece that never got anywhere. Oddworld releases many of
it's pre production images to our fans because they are so "art"
oriented.

<p><b>Alf:</b> Please remember that fans from around the world come to these
forums. Writing and understanding English is not easy for some.  
I think some fans might be misunderstood due to their lack of writing

to be tolerate and understanding of all Oddworld's Inhabitants.

<p><b>Alf:</b> You are correct Abe Babe. We look out for fans who inspire
US.  
We don't say "Hey, who should be fan of the month this month?" and
search for someone to fill that spot. It's usually the opposite.  
for example: We recently had 3 fans we wanted to honor and we honored
them one at a time. Lantra had to wait a few months!

Sometimes we go months without any fom's. Not because there are no
deserving fans, we just need a break.

thanks for asking!

<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> A fan has never been invited by us to tour the studio. We
receive requests from fans from the forums, students, fans of the game,
teachers etc. Each request is reviewed and it's determined whether a
tour should be granted or not. Sometimes it's just by "luck" and good
timing, as we have slow periods and busy periods during production. When
we are really busy, we don't allow any non inhabitants in the studio.
Actually we prefer fans not to elaborate on their tours as it's a
priviledge not a right. So there have been folks who have toured who
have never said a word in public about it. Hope this clears up any
misconceptions.  
Any other questions?

<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> My dearest One, Two...  
Tho protest too much!  
Here are the facts:  
One: According to A.E. it is never stated that the muds walked in One
day. We see morning to dusk but there is no indication that this is the
same day? When we cut to the muds running to Necrum, it could possibly
be a different day but the same time of day. This is definitely
debatable.  
Two: There is no measurement of distance or miles on the map. None.  
Three: Yes, Oddworld is 10 times the size of Earth.  
Since there is no size comparision to Earth, then we can assume that the
planet is indeed big.

Four: If Mudos is bigger than Earth, wouldn't it take longer for the
planet to complete a full rotation? And if it is farther from the sun  
than Earth, wouldn't the rotations be even slower still? And wouldn't
that make for more daylight hours?

Wil Bunce-Edwards: This true story doesn't seem to be well-known
enough. I'll tall it again. After Abe's Oddysee came out, one fan wrote
to OWI suggesting that Mudokons could have more of a personality so that
players would sympathise more, which of course we got. Incredibly, this
fan actually sued OWI for taking aboard his/her idea, and OWI had to
stump up the cash. So, they're very cautious about how they deal with
such requests. I'm sure that there will be a few 'easter egg' names,
though.

</p>

<p><b>Alf:</b> Just so ya'll know, Oddworld has never been sued by a fan, and

<p><b>Alf:</b> Wow Sligslinger! You have a lot of confidence and passion!
These are important traits when looking for a job in the gaming
industry. I just want to wish you the best of luck. If you really want a
job in games, I know you can make it happen! Just keep in mind there is
a lot of hard (and fun!) work involved in getting there first. An
internship is a great idea, and an excellent way to get your foot in the
door at a game developer. Oddworld is, well, Odd in that we've never
done internships, but lots of game studios do. It is a fun and effective
way of getting into the games business.

As for tours, we do not have "guides" here at Oddworld, sorry. We have a
few kind employees who have taken time out of their work schedules to
make it happen from time to time, but we don't really officially give
tours, especially when we are facing a busy production schedule. And on
the rare occasion that a tour was granted, I swear on my finest fez that
no money changed hands!!!!

Have a great trip to Cali- We are enjoying balmy 90 degree weather here
in SLO : )

Odd Luck!!!!!

all the movies have been compiled on a single source separate from the

make sure you get it, due to the limited time offer status. If you get

the record, Munch won't be coming to PSN, it relies on too many
Xbox-specific technologies.

Web 2.0 has really taken off since we first took a break from the radar,
and we're still getting used to it. Hopefully you know that my usual gig
is to release monthly Q&As, but under Web 2.0 that can seem slow, even
rude. I was wondering what you dedicated folks on the forums thought
about this.

You might have noticed the cheeky "Volume 1" label on the latest Dear

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> She could do but have to search through all that fat to find
them, and I don't feel that's my job. Love you, mamma!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do you have any holidays or celebrations soon? Do you get cake when
you celebrate? You ever had cake? I love cake...

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Cake is delicious. I like popberry cake. Mmmm, popberries.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Can I come to Oddworld yet? I've been waiting for ages :)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Just board your next blimp.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What goes into the creation of a Mudokon queen? Are they
pre-determined to be royalty from birth or do new queens develop (from
the work caste for example) when there's a biologicial need for them?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oh ho ho, you almost had me there! I typed out a full
explanation but just before I submitted I realized that you are actually
an evil Vykkers Scientist bent on enslaved the Mudokon race all the more
by breeding a whole farm of Mudokon queens, all producing thousands and
thousands of Labor Eggs! Looks like you're trying to trick the wrong
Mudokon!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf have you ever drank soul storm brew?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Never played Abe's Exoddus, huh?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do you ever get sick of answering questions? Especially from a
certain cake lover? Or ones that are in your FAQ?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I definitely get sick of answering the same questions over and
over. You'd think people would READ THE FAQ but it's evident some of
them just don't READ THE FAQ before coming to me. I'm not quite sure why
they'd rather slow down the making of the games instead of just READING
THE FAQ, but apparently our FAQ is haunted or something because they
just won't READ THE FAQ.

What's a Mud to do?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, don't you think it's strange to call your own world "odd"
? Or Mudokons aren't the ones who called it that way ? That would be
quite odd !

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Your planet is named after a substance of which it comprises
only the tiniest fraction by mass or volume. Who's odd now?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I'm pretty sure people don't read the FAQ because they like the
charming and witty responses from you personally... Do you like how I
replaced 'sarcastic' with 'charming and witty'?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Did you use a thesaurus for that?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do you have a theme tune? If so, can I hear it?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yes, it goes:

He's Alf! He's Alf!  
Want tea? Go to Alf!  
Don't burp! Don't slurp!  
Don't chug! Just sip!

Too dry? Just add water!  
Don't like tea? Well ya oughta!  
Got a question? He'll answer!  
He's a comic! He's a dancer!

He's Alf! Wears a fez!  
Hey shut up! They're the best!  
Want good drink? Or company?  
Go to Alf's Rehab & Tea!

<p><b>Question:</b> Following the release of Sonic Generations where Sonic meets his
past self, if you could meet your past self, what would you say or do to
him or her?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Make me a cup of tea!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Can I share now?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> NO! JUST SHUT UP!

</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> A wild Slig appeared! What will Alf do? -Fight -Tea -Call Abe
-Run

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Save game, turn off system, go and get some work done.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What language(s) do you speak?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Mudokon and Fannish.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Who is smarter? A Slig or an Outlaw?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I hate to suggest that an Outlaw is smart, but they at least
have survival skills. Out there in the lawless stretches of Western
Mudos they need to have their wits about them to survive. True they
leech of Clakkerz and Grubbs, but that itself isn't an /unwise/
decision. Most Sligs would perish in the wild, never having learnt how
to fend for themselves.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do Sligs and Slegs have some ancestors in common ?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No more than a moose and a goose.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is it an insult when Outlaws calls Stranger pretty?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Stranger may be a rough and rugged one-dude bountying machine,
but he takes better care of himself than Outlaws do. Outlaws believe in
survival and power over hygeine. By calling Stranger pretty they're
calling into question his strength and hence his ability to prevail in
combat. Don't worry too much about it, it's Outlaw logic.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do Mudokons have an equivalent to a Human Christmas and would you
have Scrab Cakes and a big juicy Paramite for dinner?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Everyone needs a celebration of light to get them through the
dark days of the colder months!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will there be any more Oddworld merchandise available in the
future? Anymore shirts?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oh absolutely. We're looking into a variety of things,
including more shirts.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Can we dress Sligs in skirts?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You can try, but I wouldn't recommend it. Only way you can do
it and survive is to pay them.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will Munch HD have stuff that was cut out of the original game?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Munch's Oddysee IS the original game, and Munch HD will be the
HD version of it. It would be harder than popping a Slig's buttzit to
add new content with the outdated pipeline that game used, and it would
only improve the game in a sentimental way. Not that sentiment is bad,
but we have to prioritize! You can't paint your Rehab before you've
built its walls!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why doesn't anyone push down a Glukkon?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Because nobody fancies spending the rest of their short lives
in solitary confinement undergoing torture.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do Slogs lay eggs like the Mudokon queen?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No, no one lays eggs quite like the Mudokon queen. Her style is
irreproducible.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What do Outlaws, Clakkers, Grubbs, Wolvarks and Steef eat?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Fish and Gabbits.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, how do you comunicate with us? Are you able to see our
messages by chanting? Or have you stole a computer from the Glukkons?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It's easy to get distracted by technicalities. The important
thing is that it works.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Alf! I got a question buddy, were you one of the 99 mudokons abe
saved from Rupture farms? If so which one?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I was, but don't ask me to remember which one. Can you remember
what shift you were working in 1997?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What has lorne lanning been up to recently? I havent heard anything
about except doing movie he was trying to do.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Lorne and Sherry have been working on their new venture for the
last few years, but they're still about making sure Oddworld is doing
the right thing.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do you farm and eat meeps?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No. I leave the farming to the farmers and the eating to the
eaters.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do you guys have a day like Valentine's Day in Oddworld?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No, we all hate each other.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Did Abe ever talk to you about pushing him into the Big Well?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> He thanked me for helping him in his adventure. Anything less
and I'd have been insulted.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do you miss your mom?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I've never met her, so not really.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> When i post on the oddworld inhabitants website my post never
apears to stay, why?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Probably because I haven't gotten around to moderating it yet.
Give me time! I've only got two hands! Sheesh.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Don't you have anything better do to then answer questions from
us?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I absolutely do not!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How does Stranger suck all those Outlaws in his bag? It's a small
bag... is it like a bottomless bag with a vacuum in it?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It's a can. Ocassionally the canning factories glitch and put
huge amounts of negative pressure where they should be doing the
opposite. If you know exactly what to look for, if you know how to tap
it just right, you can find cans just like it in stores across Oddworld.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is it true that Oddworld is going to head in a lighter direction?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Nonsense. Oddworld will always retain its blend of gruesome
horror, playfulness and ironic humor.

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Can you tell me anything about The Hand of Odd, other than that it
is a multi-player game that is coming out after Munch’s Oddysee?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hand of Odd is about us using the technology of Munch,
enhancing upon it, and bringing it into the multiplayer world of gaming.
How many players will be able to interact at one time is still yet to be
determined. If we can get 8 players at one time for Hand of Odd we will
be happy. It will be enough. If we can get more we will be ecstatic.
Hand of Odd will not be an online community in the way that Everquest or
Ultima Online are. But we do plan to take advantage of features like
downloadable units that will help to keep the world fresh even after
it’s been out there awhile. Our most important function will be speed.
We'll take advantage of as much as we can until update rates become an
issue. There as so many questions that relate to the multiplayer
Internet capabilities that are yet to be answered technically, that we
can't lock down to the degree that we would like yet.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What can you tell us about the story and gameplay of Hand of
Odd?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Think eco-extremists versus corporate greed. It's Exxon vs.
Greenpeace and you get to choose which one you want to be. There are
three sides, or ideologies, wrapped into one playing field. You will be
able to choose between one of three master characters for three
different races. Each of these three characters will have the ability to
control masses of their own kind. Each of the three has interests that
conflict with the others. It can be played competitively, or
cooperatively, or you can just exist and experiment while nurturing a
particular world. You may choose to have full-scale conflicts, or just
make a lot of moolah via destroying it. We are also out for something
that can be left on and grow while you're not even home. We're after
fully persistent universes that have a life of their own. Eco-system
simulation is a big part of the next level for the Oddworld games. We
really want you to take ownership of the world, and then deal with the
inevitabilities that arise out of your behavior of your forces.

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will you ever develop games for Macintosh? Dreamcast?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There are currently no concrete plans to do so, but if it makes
sense to us in the future we certainly will.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What will the PC requirements be for Munch’s Oddysee?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> At this time, it is too soon to be determined. We still won't
know for a few months.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Are you still planning on coming out with an Oddworld movie?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> We see the five stories of the epic of the Oddworld Quintology
eventually becoming five motion pictures. However, there is no rush for
us to produce the feature films. They may happen sooner than later, but
we won't compromise game development just to make movies. The game
medium is too important to us.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b>  Why did Abe go from having four fingers in the Abe’s Oddysee to
having three in Abe’s Exoddus?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, it's a long story that needs to be told. So here it is...
Japan has a strict discriminating policy against any simulated
characters entering their country with four fingers. Historically, Japan
has had a subclass of meatpacking workers that were typically looked
down upon in their society. In later days, the blatant displaying of a
four-fingered hand gesture, intentionally directed at another, came to
mean that you were calling them a member of the meatpacking subclass.
Which, we understand, was not at all a compliment.

It appears that the four finger connection with the meat packing class
was due to work-related accidents, but was so frequent that it came to
symbolically represent the sub-class. It seems as though this is a part
of the Japanese history that some groups within Japan would like to see
forgotten. Therefore, it is at great risk that you publish four-fingered
characters in Japan, as you may very likely end up in legal battles with
a vociferous pressure group. This group claims that this type of
representation is equivalent to and as degrading as the yellow star
forced to be worn on Jews by the Nazi's during the Second World War.That
is, it's offensive and degrading unless they can extort enough money out
of you. Then it's all okay. Case in point: We were told that the Walt
Disney Corporation is charged five million dollars a year by this group
so that Mickey Mouse may live in Japan and retain his original four
fingered design. Otherwise, old Mickey would need to see a surgeon and
have something done about that insulting forth finger.

The moral of this story is... if you want to pay, then it's ok. If you
don't want to pay, then it's a horrible insult to our culture. In other
parts of the world, we have a word for these types of two-faced tactics.
We call it extortion. If it is truly offensive and degrading, then don't
allow it at all. But to allow it for a price... is to belittle the case
altogether. It suggests that the real truth behind these groups is that
they are using the darker moments in their own cultures' history as an
excuse to coerce money out of content providers.

Well, being that this is Oddworld, we felt that this seemed like a
perfect addition to the Abe story. We thought it was ironically perfect
that he was being discriminated against for being who he was. As the
message came from Japan, "They don't like his kind here,” with the
sincere suggestion, "Just chop off one of his fingers cause you don't
have the money to pay up..." caused us to feel that we indeed needed to
allow Abe to go through the suffering that goes along with being a poor
slob at the bottom of the Food chain. Yup, we chopped off his finger so
that the Japanese wouldn't get offended (or paid). He didn't like it one
bit, but due to the fact that there ain't much he can do about it... we
decided that he could donate his finger rather than us donating five
million dollars. Such is life in Japan when you’re a four-fingered
meatpacking worker.

And that is how Abe lost his finger in Japan. He's still pretty pissed
off about it, but we convinced him that with the amount of games sold in
Japan, he still might be able to get his message through to their
culture someday. As a true believer in his cause, he felt that the
sacrifice of a finger was but a small price to pay in hoping to shed
some light on discriminations and injustices the world over.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Can you tell me what Lorne Lanning’s email address is so I can
write him?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No, we really can’t give that out. Lorne is a very busy man
spending up to 80 hours a week creating the Oddworld games, and although
he would love to respond to everyone, he doesn’t have the time. Most of
the fan mail does come his way though, so he does read your encouraging
words and sees the great fan art. This is what reminds him and all of us
at Oddworld that all the hard work is definitely worth the effort. So,
keep the letters and art coming!

'Till next time, this is the number one Mud that ain't no dud -- so when

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Do the Scrabs in the Mudanchee vault try to eat you because
they've been in there for years, do all the Scrabs eat you guys, or is
Abe either at the bottom of the food chain or just so darn tasty?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hmph, now that's an interesting thought. I wonder what we do
taste like. I mean, Molluck's entire corporation went to the mat tryin'
to make ol' Abe into an entree, and them Scrabs'll punch a hole through
a landwhale if they think there's one of us on the other side... Tell ya
what, I'll take up biting my fingernails, and let you know my findings.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey dude, I wanted to ask you a question. Is there any Mudokon
women out there in Oddworld? How the heck do these creatures reproduce,
man? Do you know any other Oddworld fans who have an AOL screen name?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> If you haven't seen any of Oddworld's women yet, you must not
be looking! And good for you at that... Odd knows ever since I caught a
glimpse of 'em, I've tried mighty hard not to look. ...yech. \shivers\
And if you're having trouble finding other Oddworld fans, try throwing a
brick. Or swinging a cat. The little buggers are all over the place;
they must be, what with the number of letters I gotta answer...
razza-frazzin' no good...

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why does Abe loose his tattoos between Abe's Oddysee and Abe's
Exoddus?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Last time I was playing jacks with Abe, he still had them
tattoos on his hands... and a darn good thing. He'd never have made it
outta the brewery if he hadn't been able to call up the power of the
Shrykull once or twice when he got into a pinch. Next thing you know the
little punk will spike his hair or get his lips pierced. Uh. Again, that
is. You know what I mean. Eh, next question.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is it true that you will be able to load up your Mudokon friends
with blitzpackers, snuzis, and tomahawks and send them on rampages
through factories. Or are these special power-ups for sligs and other
creatures only? And When you posses a slig can you go to a vending
machine and get power ups like the super bounce and other armnants.
PLEASE REPLY!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Don't you get snippy with me there, youngster! Remember, I'm a
recovering substance abuser, I could snap at any moment!! It's little
ragamuffins like you that're driving this whole oddworld into the- huh?
My editor is gesturing frantically at me... Right, right, sorry, I do
believe it's time for my medicine. \gulp gulp gulp\ Whoo, that herbal
chamomile stuff sure hits the spot. Okay... right... count to ten...
Okay.

If you gave one of these Mudokon chumps around here a Blitzpacker or a
Snuzi, he'd probably use it for a fencepost, or a headdress ornament, or
a garden hoe. We're just not that sharp with technology. Conversely,
give a slig one of our tomahawks and he'd probably be squished under
it's weight. You seen the skinny little sissy arms them fellas have? As
for vending machines, well, sure, maybe you could buy an instrument of
mass destruction or two, but then if I had Moolah to burn and vending
machines about, I'd buy the sauce. I mean, that's what those machines
are best for, getting blotto right quick- Huh? What? Right, sorry, more
medicine... \gulp gulp gulp\ ahhhhhh...
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I can't believe that you Mudokons are sooo corrupt! All the new
movies and trailers are all supported by Microsoft/Windows media
programs! What happened to all the QuickTime goodness!? Did Bill Gates
hand u some Moolah under the table? Or did he hand it to the Glukkons
and they screwed everything up?!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Uh oh... Uh... Yeah, that second one you said. The one about
the Glukkons? Yeah. They're responsible for it, they always are! Those
Glukkon creeps! We're innocent, we were just following orders! We did
NOT have monetary relations with that man!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was wondering. Since there is a queen for each of the races on
Oddworld. Is there a slog queen?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There must be. I bet the Glukkons have her stashed somewhere
where they can make obscene profits off her babies. That's so like them
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What's your take on linear games vs. non-linear games. Do you
think it's possible to have a non-linear game with a solid story? Which
type of game will Munch be?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There's a place for linear and non-linear play in any kind of
game. Munch's Oddysee does have an overall direction, but within each
'level' the play is wide open. We found that that gave us the kind of
freedom for the players and let us keep the story on track. You can have
story in a non-linear game, but we found that the story either didn't
follow the in-game action, or we didn't always get the story we wanted
to tell. We kept the broad structure of Munch linear so we could tell
exactly the story we wanted and get the emotional impact we were looking
for.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I've always wondered why Mudokon's mouths are 'sewn' together. If
the Glukkons wanted them to shut up, it didn't work very well. They
should've stapled them. :) Why does Abe have stitched lips?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, they worked pretty well at first, but Glukkons aren't
much for long-term thinking or quality control. With the headlock they
have on management on Oddworld, they don't really have to be. So, after
a while, the stitches get loose, and Abe and the other workers can talk
again, some.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, why is there a crater on the Oddworld moon that is the
shape of a Mudokon hand?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I dunno. I always wonder why my hand looks like that shape on
the moon. Maybe someday we'll find out.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do the organisms of Oddworld have common names and scientific
names? If so what are they?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Only the Vykkers would know that, and I'm not getting close
enuf to them to ask.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey, I was wondering if you could give me some information on the
Almighty Raisin?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The Raisin has four eyes and they glow a bright yellow. He is
quite large so he can only move very slowly and has labored breathing.
His skin is like the bark of a tree mixed with a raisin and it's
purplish brown. He is wise and all knowing but often tires and falls
asleep in mid sentence. He is the guide for Abe and Munch through the
game and tells them what they have to find and do to achieve their
different goals.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What do the Mudokons eat? They all seem to have a slight gas
problem. Is it just something they do to pass time? Or do they agree
with me about Madonna?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It's not the eats that do it to us, it's the drink, the Brew,
the juice, the sauce, the
hair-o-the-slog-that-ripped-your-leg-off-so-now-everybody-gave-you-the-nickname-'Pogo-Boy'.
That Brew will get you tooting like a souzaphone, but if you're drinking
that sweet, sweet- er, horrible, nasty, addictive stuff, then passing
time or gas was the least of your worries.

</div>

from where to download it.

<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You're a person of discerning taste, you are. None of the
new-fangled be-bop for you, just the pure, motivational stylings of the
RuptureFarms PA system, eh? Well, after a quick glance on the
Alfabetizer (my state of the art super-computer... it's kind of like
that big evil MCP computer in 'TRON', but without the lasers or
diabolical sentience... I use it most of the time to play Minesweeper),
I couldn't find much of anything in the way of stylish Oddworld tunes,
either. Come down to the rehab center sometime with a tape recorder and
we'll all hum a few bars for ya to tide you over.

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I know you probably are going to tell me that you can't legally
tell me but I want to know how I can change some of the sounds in
Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus specifically the background noise so I can shove
some teen music in there (Oddworld has a great soundtrack please don't
be offended!)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I would never tell you something like that! What I will tell
you is to lose that teeny-bopper crap yer listening to. Land sakes, the
things that pass for music these days woulda caused folks in my day to
hold their nose just in case a foul smell was short in coming... Get
yerself some Grass Roots, or The Platters... you know, they did that one
that went "Smoke... Gets... In... Your.....
EEEEEEEYYYYYYYEEEEEESSSSSS-HACK ACK \cough cough wheeze\"... eh...
whoo... and so forth. Then we'll talk.

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do Glukkons like to be tickled behind their ears? I've been
toying with this notion for quite a while now.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Would you say that the majority of the notions that you toy
with are of a similar subject matter and caliber as this one? If so,
well, whatever mows your lawn, I guess, though you might want to
consider therapy... me personally, I wouldn't know; I wouldn't touch a
Glukkon's skin with a hunnerd'n eighty foot I-beam even while
schnockered.

enser alf plz!

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: I was wondering why fleeches and slurgs work together. It's like
they are twins!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I dunno if I'd call that 'working together', buddy. Think
about it... if every time somebody stepped on you and smashed you into a
pile of goo, a pizza was delivered to your next door neighbor... would
you say that the two of you are working together? If so, you might wanna
renegotiate your end of the bargain.

<p><b>Question:</b> Is it possible to make food that looks just like Scrab Cakes and
Paramite Pies?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hey, throw enough food-coloring, lipstick, or concentrated
laundry bleach into a recipe, and you could get it to look like just
about anything! But sadly, the taste, well, there's nothing like the
real thing. Ah- not that I'd eat Scrab Cakes or Paramite Pies, being
made from them endangered critters and all. I could do that. But that
would be wrong.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I heard that a Meeches' favorite prey is an Elum. Is this true?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Chicks dig Elum. Not Meeches. 'Sides, I can't imagine how they
could've preyed upon something as stupid as Elums and still managed to
get their dumb selves extinctified.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Everyone knows that Scrabs can't stand each other, so what's with
the "Large Scrab Herd" video?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Uh. They're Union Scrabs? I dunno, YOU go ask'em... maybe if
yer real polite they won't accidentally knock you over and tear you to
shreds first. Me, I'll be happy to just smile and nod at whatever they
show on the Oddworld Nature Channel.

Playstation it ripped. Well I'm 13 and my brothers are 16 and 19 and I
want to know how much will the Xbox cost and I wanna tell U I love
Scrabs they are cool I even did a project on Oddworld so U can tell I"m
pretty obsessed. This is what I really wanna know will it be 3D like can
you only walk straight or on a diagonal and can you please answer me Alf

Okay. Now. Lemme see... Thanks; 35,299 Moolah here (dunno the

again!! I just had a couple after work to take the edge off, I promis-
... whoa. Okay, maybe time for the next question...
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> If most of the prominent Oddworldian species breed like hive
insects (that is, with a single Queen producing hordes of sterile
workers) and the Mudokon Queen, Sam, is in a Glukkon facility, then how
are the free-born Mudokon born in the first place?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hmm... is that where I came from? My foster slig always told
me he found me underneath a dew-covered Spooce Shrub on a sunny spring
day. I always thought it sounded kinda romanticized...
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> In Munch's Oddysee, is Abe going to have another "special
ability" from a tattoo or something similar like the Shrykull and
Mudokon healing tattoos?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The last two times Abe called everybody out saying he'd
acquired a new power, they turned out to be card tricks. I don't even
bother to check anymore.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Can you maybe send me a complete list of the Mudokon language? 

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Write me up an English dictionary in your free time and I'll
swap ya.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is BlitzPacker Brew the same as SoulStorm Brew, or is it a
competing brand, or what? If it's difference, what is it made of (as
compared to SoulStorm being bones and tears)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I think BlitzPacker Brew comes in a special, heavier can, so
it'll leave bigger dents in things it's shot at, ya know, like walls,
our skulls, etc.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Abe blew up SoulStorm Brewery, right? Why is it that those
cannon-toting vending machines fire SoulStorm Brew then? Is there more
than one brewery?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You think if we blew up one brewery on your planet that beer
would cease to exist? Here on Oddworld, there's a simple rule... if it
turns a profit, you can bet yer ponytail there'll be more'n one of
'em...
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will there ever be an evolutionary chain picture of how
Oddworld's creatures came to be?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yeah, I seen you people's idea of evolution. Everytime I try
and picture a hunchbacked, overmuscled Mudokon with extra hair toting an
enormous club over his shoulder, I gotta start laughin- huh? Whozere?
Oh, ah, heh heh, hiya Tom. No, no no no, I wasn't talkin' about you or
any of the other Tomahawkers... yeah, go on back outside.

Right, so, um... what were we talking about?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, I was wondering...in Munch's Oddysee when U rescue the
Fuzzles do they follow you the rest of the game, or do they leave after
a while?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Munch considered the viability of a legion of the little
critters at his beck and call 'till we had him watch that Star Trek
episode about Tribbles. Since then he's been pretty keen on just getting
them free from their cages, into a rescue portal, and out of his sight.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do Gabbits not have a Queen cuz most others do and if they don't
are they asexual?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Munch don't know, and Munch don't wanna know. Think about his
situation, after all... if he pulls of this caper and gets that Gabbiar,
he'll have saved his race, sure. But then when all those baby Gabbits
start asking 'Where did we come from?' he either has to make something
up, or else say "Well, a can, actually." Even if Munch had somebody to
ask, I think he'd be afraid to for getting a similar answer.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Where did you get the name Exoddus from? Did you get it from the
Bible because there's a book in the bible called "Exodus"?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I think that Lorne guy read it off of a Successories poster in
a mall and thought it sounded cool.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf! Where the heck do you live? I mean, so you live on a
drifting continent? What does your planet look like? I would like to
know. It's o.k. if you don't know.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I'm glad you gave me that out there at the end; I was gonna be
having major fits of introspection about my self-worth if I got this
wrong. At a guess, I'm gonna say it looks round and bumpy. With, you
know, bits of blue, brown, and green spots, like an overripe Spooce
Shrub or something. Fact is, I don't know. You gotta get pretty far away
from a planet to be able to tell what it looks like. Munch might've
gotten a good look when he plummeted out of the Lab, but I think he was
a bit distracted by shrieking "I'M GONNA DIEEEE!!!!!!" at the top of his
lungs at the time.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What is the Brewmaster Glukkon's real name? I refuse to believe
that his name actually is "Brewmaster".

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hey, he's one of the lucky ones. Just imagine how Gas Station
Attendant Glukkon feels... he can't even get his whole name onto a loan
application.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> On Munch's Oddysee, a creature's appearance changes depending on
status or health, right? In this magazine article I saw a "Slig Health
chart" that showed increasing amounts ofinjury like casts and crutches
and stuff. In the same article there was also a "Slig Status Chart"
where a slig was shown with increasing amounts of armor and firepower.
Also, the article quoted Lorne Lanning talking about socially contorted
GameSpeak, where a mid-status creature would speak insultingly to his
inferiors, normally to his equals, and subserviently to his superiors.
Did all this awesome stuff make it into the game?!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hey yeah, I saw some of those sligs walkin' around in
wierd-lookin' suits of platemail... I thought they were having a Ren
Fest or something. Don't count on seeing any slig in a cast, though. A
slig in a cast is a slig on sick leave, and a slig on sick leave is a
liability that his boss would just as soon recycle as let heal.

And if you want socially contorted gamespeak, step on down to my little
rehab center sometime. Where the tea flows like brew, the brew don't
flow at all, and the conversation'll make a sailor blush.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> When characters are damaged in Munch's Oddysee, will they show
signs of injury? For instance, say Abe wandered where he shouldn't again
and was shot. Even if he's only holding onto life by a thread, will he
still be able to run and jump at his maximum potential, or will he be
forced to hobble around at a horrendously reduced speed? Just
wondering.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> That's one of the things that didn't make the cut for this
game. Look for some kind of visible damage in Munch 2. We have really
cool concept art on one or our conference room walls. Right now, the
thinking in the designers' dungeon is that slowing down abe or munch
when they hurt isn't much fun, but they've changed their minds before...
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Helloooooooo! Were there any sligs who were friends with you and
Abe?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Once there was a slig named Wildum who was kind of a nice guy
to me and Abe. He didn't beat us, and he'd even let us have a drink, if
we brought him one, too. The other sligs found out, and they beat him to
death with his own arms. It was horrible.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was wondering if the Big Brother Sligs crawl around on their
hands like other sligs do?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I dunno but back by popular demand is Crig the Slig to answer
all those Slig related questions. Crig is a freelance writer for the
Daily Deception.

</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will we ever see a Slig without a mask?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Pray you don't. Your eyes will melt in their sockets and
your brain will explode. We are UGLY. Uglier than your kid sister.
Uglier than ... words fail me. Even we don't like to look at us; that's
how ugly we are.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How smart are Sligs in comparision to Glukkons, Interns and
Vykkers?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, we think we're the smartest, cause we get to shoot the
guns and bombs. Glukkons think they're smart, cause they get most of the
Moolah and the good cigars. Vykkers think they're smart, cause they know
lots of stuff (like how to cut someone open so it hurts the most; you
know, useful stuff). And Interns, ... not even Interns think Interns are
smart.

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Hey, Alf. I was wondering, on this website, Abe's STATUS report
says that he has no sexual organs. Then why does Abe and his friends
wear those loin-clothes?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Style, baby. If presence of a clothing item meant there were
naughty bits beneath, people'd start wondering why you humans wear hats.
</p>

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How do Interns communicate? I've looked at pictures and couldn't
find their mouths.

</p>
<hr>

time. Even if they could talk, nobody'd listen to 'em.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi, again. Do the Mudokons take to Munch pretty well, or do they
kinda avoid him and wipe off their oversized palms after shaking hands
with him?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The most I've heard any Mudokon other than Abe say to Munch
other than giggling at him was "Heh heh, Hey, Do that thing with your
fins again so Buddy can see it!"
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What do the Zulags in RuptureFarms stand for? Do they have
anything to do with the Russian GULAGs?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> What's Russia?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do Slogs have eyes, or are they blind? if they are how do they
know where they're going?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Given their propensity for running their dumb selves right
into active minefields, my guess is they don't.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was just wondering if it was possible for other species to have
Slogs besides Sligs? If not, why?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I imagine if one got a hold of a slog pup and, over the course
of several years, regularly beat, starved, and wittily pointed out his
various inadequacies as an Oddworld being, one could ingrain the
neccessary fear and respect needed to keep it in line - provided you
never turned your back on them. That's how the Sligs do it, and only
because that's what they get paid for.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I wonder if you can answer this question which has been bugging
me for a while; how old are Aslik, Dripik, Phleg and that Brewmaster
guy? Just wanted to know, thanks for reading!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They're all 29, coincidentally enough. In fact, Phleg was 29
for at -least- the last 17 years.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> In Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus¨, the Glukkons keep talking about
Molluck. Is he supposed to be the "Master", or something like that?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Molluck pulled a lot more weight than any of those chumps did.
On Oddworld, a CEO stands head and shoulders above a Director, Vice
President, and General combined. But that's a good point... Molluck was
presumed dead after Abe was first freed from Rupture Farms... why were
those 3 so worried about him 'finding out' about the Necrum Mines
incident?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is there a level editor for Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus¨? 

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> A level editor? What, you think our existance is some kind of
GAME?!!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What Are The Requirements Of Becoming Fan Of The Month On Your
Website?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> For Starters, Conservative Use Of Capitalization In A
Sentence. Secondly, well, it's kind of ambiguous. Put it this way: You
scratch our back, we'll shave yours.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I'm curious about the 3rd Oddworld game for Xbox. What's the main
plot of it? What are Interns? Who is the big boss? (Molluck was the big
boss in the first one.) It's okay if I can't know.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Abe's and Munch have their own missions. Abe's gotta save his
brothers. And, in a way, so does Munch... Interns are lazy bums with
itchy trigger fingers who needed a summer job and subscribe to the motto
"If it's worth doing, it's worth doing later." As for the big boss...
well, hard to say. The two guys in charge are always fighting over which
of them 'wears the pants', whatever that means...
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Who is this Lulu? Lulu sounds like a girls name? Lulu is a guy
...right?

<p><b>Alf:</b> Eh. Technically, yes. Most folks who know him tend to use more
colorful adjectives.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> In the game opening of Abe's Exoddus when Abe falls a Slig flies
by and says "somethin' smells". I noticed that the Flying Slig seemed to
have 'wings' instead of 'blades' I was wondering if you could explain
this?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> He was commenting on the smell of ozone that was generating by
the lubricating oil in his wings burning away, resulting in his wings
seizing up and him plummetting to a fiery crash about 10 seconds later,
well offscreen, where you'd never have noticed. They discontinued the
winged model after that, on the completely unrelated reasoning that the
propeller model was also cheaper to manufacture.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> In the game can you switch between Abe and Munch at will or does
the story carry the switching? ex. Resident Evil CV?

</p>
<hr>

business, and we'll let you do the deciding as to who goes where and
when.

wise?

if Final Fantasy can do it so can Oddworld.

</p>

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What is the reproductive model of Elums and do they lay eggs or
give birth to live young?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, on this one, I'd have asked the Elums that are in the
upcoming Munch's Oddysee, but they were surprisingly, um, unresponsive.
Confidential to our fan who uses the handle 'Elum': I'm so very, very
sorry.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How can I kill Scrabs and the "dogs" without chanting???

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Don't go killing those Scrabs! Remember, they're sacred, holy
beasts, an endangered species, and they have to last us until breakfast
tommorrow!!!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How come Abe is blue and all the other Mudokons are green?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Back in Rupture Farms, we bet him 5 bucks he couldn't hold a
mouthful of Paramite Juice for ten minutes without swallowing. He won.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is it at all possible that Munch's Oddysee will be reformatted
for the GameCube?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It's probably equally possible that Mario will be ported for
the XBox. It's also equally possible that I'll become a responsible
'social' drinker. But I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, Joe and Matt here, we were just wondering what pieces of
crawling meat bags with extra limbs will be running around in Munch's
Exoddus, and who the hell is this guy Squeek?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hopefully not too many, for their own good... the Magog
Cartel has a rule: 'More Limbs means More Flavor!' As for Squeek...
don't know what you're talking about. Sounds ludicrous that such a
creature would exist... I mean, what kind of self-respecting being would
have an onomatopoeia for a name? \BRRRZZZZZAAAPPPTT\ GYAAHHH!!! What
the heck was that for, Munch?!

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Hi Alf! Yes I love you, you are my fav char on Oddworld. I would
do everything for you, you look so good.... :) that's enough sliming. I
think almost every fan does slimings. everywhere you see it, on the
forums if you've posted a pict at the forums (although if it really
looks bad) they say you that it's a great pict and stuff. But I hate
slimings. The people who slime all time don't tell you the truth. I
think those peps are false. I dunno but If you posted a pict or show
someone a pict, doesn't everyone just tell you it's good?

Ok but I didn't mail you just to say this. (Sorry that I waste your
time) here's my question: In AO when Abe crashes down the cliff, Big
face comes and draws this sideways 8 (the symbol for eternity) on the
ground.Then later when Abe uses his power the first time some birds fly
in front them and the form an 8. So has the 8 some meaning
orsomething?

Bye, LA

P.S. If some sentence sounds bad, evil ,arrogant or something, sorry
but my language is really bad and I never learn vocabulary. So sorry for
that.

P.S. 2: Please ask Lorne if he can put the sliming topic, or any other
things like this in the games, there are more topics that he could use
but It's so complicated to explain...

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You didn't like my picture?

</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf,  The original 2 games produced by your company were
marvelous works of infamthomable art. I studyed every peice of
information I could find. I memorized the history of Oddworld. I
completed both games with a perfect score after practice. I absorbed
every faset of the concept and every nich. I downloaded every film and
watched them over and over again. I am an artist and nothing in the past
connected to me that way. It shifted my entire approch.

I watched with starving eyes every drawing and every detail that was
released on Munch's Oddysee as they were put up. I was a fanatical with
the concept and story of Oddworld. Now I feel sick. The one company and
the one artistic vision that stood out and built me up with longing for
more let me down. Now Oddworld has stooped to the level Ninja Turtels or
lower. Sam, the thing I most anticipated, is no longer a part of the
game.

And Sobe. Why SoBe? This advertizement has destroyed the integrity of
Oddworld. They are no long real torchered, heroic, and pathetic entitys
through the minds eye. They are now simply a cheap video game. This act
has destroyed Oddworld. You people built up my hopes and obliterated
them.

Alf, I have found every flaw in Oddworld but it didn't matter before.
You said what are humans once. Now you are aware of a beverage created
by them? How is that possible? Why the let down? I still do not bealive
at this time that Lorne Lanning supported this. If he did let me know
and I will leave silently with the upmost regrets of the time I spent.

Thank you Alf for your time. I don't intend to insult.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sobe liked the message of our content and very much liked the
quirky humor and irony of our universe. The vendos appeared in the game
as an exchange for the opportunity to be a part of the sneak peak Sobe /
Xbox road show that gave the public an early opportunity to put Munch
and the Xbox in their hands.

Whenever a co-promotional opportunity arises, Oddworld's first order of
business is to see if there are any outstanding labor or environmental
issues with the potential co-sponsor. Not only did Sobe come up clean in
our search, but they have also demonstrated historic efforts to try to
raise the nutritious quality of the average mass market soft drink.

<p><b>Question:</b> For the last 2 years we have been faithful Oddies. To my dismaze,
we're now on the floor in a fetal position. HELP! When is the next
oddgame going to be released? BY CHRISTMAS 2001???

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Get off the floor and go outside! You should see "Power Ups to
the People" posters everywhere! Huge signs that say "Oddworld: Munch's
Oddysee coming out on Nov. 15th" or "March 2001 in Europe". Where have
you been? Get up and take a deep breathe, Oddworld Needs You!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey, guys at Oddworld Inhabitants! I have been so jittery about
Munch's Oddysee. First off, let me say that I have wrote to you many
times before. You already know that I am a HUGE and I mean HUGE Oddworld
fan! Absolutely love the games and everything about them and in them.

I just downloaded the new Munch trailer, you know, the one in the
beginning where a Mudokon farts and Abe says, "Dude, that's nasty." LOL.
That trailer was hilarious and Slig-kickin' AWESOME all at once! Just
seeing everything alive and moving in the new 3D world has made me
unable to wait for Munch's Oddysee!

45 days left until Xbox and, the best part of all...ODDWORLD!!!
YEAH!!!

On that Thursday, this is my plan:

1. Stay home from school and beat both Oddworlds again

2. Go to Best Buy at 10:00pm and wait in the Xbox line

3. While waiting, practice running very fast and stretching my arms as
far as they will go

4. At 12:00am, when the doors open, rush into the videogame, or should
I say Xbox section and grab and Xbox, Oddworld, Halo, and Dead or Alive
3 and pay for it

5. Get out of that unleashed hell and thank Odd that I am out alive
and in one piece, and rush back home

6. Then, last of all, hook up the Xbox and play Oddworld all night and
into the next day.

That is a very tight and risky schedule but hey, in the end it's all
worth it. I just really want to say the games you guys have created have
been the BEST! I am just so excited about Oddworld, and I think I'm too
excited. I'm acting like it is going to come out tomorrow but, NO, not
until Nov. 15th! AAAHHHHHHH! Oh well, it will be here soon enough,
although it may not seem like it.

I'm sure that you guys are just about as excited as the fans and I
are. Or maybe you have been working to death on the game so much that
when you are told, "Hey, our game that we have been working on for the
last year is out!" you say, "Get me the hell away from that game!" LOL.
But I bet you will definitely be proud of yourselves because you all
should.

I now, finally, see why you switched to Xbox. All the screen shots I
first saw were early in the game and weren't even in motion. Now that I
have seen it in its final stages and in motion, it looks better and
badder than ever! And there are tons of questions I have for you but I
would have to put them each on one e-mail.

I guess I should just wait till the game comes out to answer them
because there are so many and because you guys are very busy. But if you
want to send me anything about it being okay and that you would like to
read my questions, just e-mail me about it. My e-mail address is at the
top and I know that if you do e-mail me, you might not for a while
because you are very busy.

Take your time on the game, it is more important than my e-mail. I
will talk to you guys again soon and I just can't wait!

11.15.01.

11.15.01.

11.15.01.

You guys are the coolest! Keep up the good work and you, you stay Odd
as well. Goodbye!

<p><b>Alf:</b> Ever consider switching to Decaf?

<p><b>Question:</b> I would just like to let you know that after seeing the SoBe
BEVERAGES dispenser in a screen shot for Munch's Oddysee I have gone and
bought many many SoBe products and drink them all the time (as a matter
of fact I am drinking a SoBe Energy right now... it's giving me the
energy to write this email!!). And now my question... in Munch's Oddysee
do Munch and Abe get healed by drinking SoBe from the vending machines?
and if so is it because SoBe is full of herbs, vitamins, and other good
things that are healthy for Oddworld Inhabitants?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Ya know Brew is bad so I stay away from anything in a bottle
these days but good for you!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How do I get a msg to your whole staff to say that I am deeply
impressed with the composition and hard work and everything you have put
into this game. Just by wiewing the homepage I am chocked with the truth
of the story behind and around the game. I would just like to say that I
think this is really good. Congratulations and thank you for a great
game.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Gee Whiz, thank YOU!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was looking at some pictures of the new Munch's Oddysee game
and I saw a picture of some weird new Mudokon with fish fins on his
head, arms, and legs. I want to know, what kind of Mudokon is these guy
and what is his abilities? I also saw a picture of a bunch of weird
looking one-eyed, one foot sheep creatures, what are they and what are
their abilities?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> That Mudokon with the so-called fish fins is the Shaman. He
guides you through the game giving you clues. Sometimes he's a real
pain, but ya gotta listen to him.

The one-eyed creature is called a Meep.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, i just went to vykkerslabs.com and it showed some
pictures of purple hairless fuzzles while others are cover with brown
hair. What's up with that?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Those hairless creatures are Fuzzles, or what use to be
Fuzzles before the Vykkers Scientists did their twisted experiments on
them.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Because my sister (Cindy) is such a big odd fan I am infected
with the disease too. And so I want to know, Why is Elum so cranky,
stubborn, selfish and smells like a burst sewer pipe??? So why is he SO
STUPID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And Alf your the sweetest!!! .

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Gee, thanks! Elum got the looks but not the brains. Elums
aren't smart enough to bathe. They lack the ability to "think"
reasonably gives them headaches. But Elums are cute and as you and your
sister are living proof, chicks dig Elum.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey, I've been a fan of the Oddworld series since the initial
release of the first game. I've proselytized far and wide about the
virtues to both Abe games. When Munch jumped ship to Xbox from PS2,
while saddened that I would have to wait longer for the next game in the
quintology, I remained steadfast in my belief that whatever was done
would be for the benefit of the game and would only make the final
product better.

Lately though, I have been getting progressively more worried. The
final straw, as it were, was the inclusion of Munch as a visualization
in Windows Media Player and the shameless plug for Microsoft Plus on the
Oddworld website. With so many blatant Microsoft-appeasing actions of
this type appearing in connection with Oddworld, I have finally had to
acknowledge Oddworld Inhabitants as an unabashed sellout.

So my question comes down to this: How can Oddworld Inhabitants
justify to me, one of their die-hard fans, their sellout? This isn't a
PS2 vs. Xbox issue. This is a monopoly issue. This is about becoming
that which the games themselves regard as the ultimate evil. The
Oddworld games are fundamentally built around anti-corporate ideals.
Abe, Munch, and their brethren represent the little people who are
crushed under the vast corporate machine. How can you, Oddworld
Inhabitants, expect us to feel compassion and connection to the travails
of these characters when you yourselves have become part of that
terrible corporate machine? I appreciate the need for development
moolah. I'm not stupid. I work in the CG world as well. It's cutthroat
out there, especially now. But you seem to have been doing fine when you
were your own company. You cited better equipment as your reason for
switching to Xbox, not a massive Microsoft bribe. How can you be such
blatant hypocrites?

I really want an answer to this. And I don't want any corporate
rhetoric either. I want a real answer as to why I should accept the
anti-corporate message of the Oddworld games even though the makers
themselves are Glukkons.

With waning hope, --Coby

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oddworld ain't anti-corporate, first of all. Oddworld's a
business, and just like any other, to make our product, we rely on
people buying them and then we use that money to pay the scrubs in the
pens to crank out code and art and design. When we were asked to be part
of the Plus! visualization we were excited that millions of people would
be able to enjoy Munch too. Aren't Sony and Nintendo big corporations
too?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hello!!! (ugh....what a "eccentric" way to
begin....)...well...what can we write in a first letter to a
Mudokon........ Ok, I already know! How you could easily see, my
nickname it's a little odd (maybe not for ya), was something "inspired"
in Abe's Oddysee......but wasn't to talk 'bout my name that I writte for
ya! I writte just for freak, yeah!!! (just kidding....) I'm
talking/writting from Brazil (do you know where is it???) and, let me to
warn you that my English isn't sooo good, coz I'm still learning, and I
know you are a nice guy and WILL understand my situation, right?

Sadly, here there's not so many fans of Abe (don't you think he's
cute?? Like we say in my language: Tao fofinho!!!!!! Or inJapanese too:
Kawaii!!!!!). Hey?? Why Abe himself doesn't answeres at least the
praises sometimes????? If Crig can, Abe can too!

What do you think 'bout teach me some interesting words (or even
badwords, he, he....) in....hmmm....your idiom has a special name in
English??? Oh, ok, in your language?? I can teach you some words too, if
you prefer to exchange....(........what stupid subject,
hum.............).

But, my dear Alf....explaine more about the Mudokon's reproduction,
more scientific things, understand? I promise I'll try to make a good
Fan Art, Ok? Lemme ask ya something: do you know what is a woman?? I
guess.....like....I finish here. (this mail was just to bother you a
little, he, he!)

So...........Tchau!!! (good bye) Kudanchee!!!!

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: I'd like to know why you Mudokons are always the victim of the
Glukkons. Are you weaker or something??? (I don't think so, so don't be
offended).

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, lets look at it this way. Suppose you're thrown into an
arena, barefisted, with a toy poodle, and only one of you can leave.
Sounds like you're at the advantage, right? Now suppose you're thrown
into an arena, barefisted, with a toy poodle, but this poodle happens to
be well funded and has a retinue of 200 pound guards with shotguns in
front of him. Your odds suddenly take a dip.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I know that Mudokons are good, Glukkons are bad, Sligs work for
the Glukkons...which make them kind of bad and Vykkers are mad
scientists. What kind of nature are Interns?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They're on par with the Sligs... lazy creeps that are in it
just because it's an easy job and they get to carry guns. Rather than
nap all the time, they just leave their headphones on and never listen
to their co-workers.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will there EVER be Oddworld toys that I can buy and play with? 

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You never know. Eh. Well, wait, I should rephrase that. I
never know.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What is that green gas in the background of the SligBarracks? 

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> And you thought Abe had bad gas.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> During a recent binge on Brew--which I will never, as Odd as my
witness ever repeat again, I swear--I had an idea. An epiphany, if you
will. All those other guys get all the glory cause they're "heroes" and
"godlings" and "chosen ones," etc. (And rest assured, there is a point
here, my good friend.)

Now, granted that none of them started out that way. Our good ol'
buddy Abe was a janitor for chanting out loud... But the way I see it,
you're a bit of an unsung hero, Alf.

And also, did Abe ever thank all those nice Mudokons who rescued him
from RuptureFarms, hmm? (Yes, yes, he saved them from the factory, but
does that REALLY make it all right?)

My point is this, Alf, dear Mudokon, ally to the addicted, buddy to
the beaten, dear friend to the down-trodden, when will it be your time
to shine? We all appreciate all you've done for the Mudokons and
creatures of Oddworld, but when will you finally get the recognition you
deserve--nay--have a right to? Although I know you'd never ask for
something like that...you're just too modest. Well here's to you, buddy,
drinks're on me.

To Alf--urp, hold on...brew's coming back up.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> ...(sniffle) ...I'm all choked up... All I ever wanted was to
be recognized, to hear somebody tell me 'I done good' ... to get out
from the shadow of Abe... To think I turned to Brew to try and cure my
depression, when all I really needed to do was roll up my sleeves and
get out there with the rest of them and do the job, get my buddies off
the sauce, make a difference. Well buddy, you've renewed my dedication.
I'm getting back on that stage and helping my fellow muds again... just
as soon as my Soaps are done.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Could you give me some information on Director Phleg that no-one
else knows yet?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> He used to be a punk Glukkon. You know that thing Gene Simmons
does with his tongue? Phleg coulda put him to shame.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I've heard that the Sligs are gonna get new weapons and stuff, so
can you please tell me what their names are, how they look like and what
they can do to others? Yeah, and will the BigBro Sligs talk like the
normal Sligs. I have hundreds of questions since it's kinda hard to get
magazines about Abe and his friends down in New Zealand here.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The philosophy behind the Magog Cartel's weapons development
division seems to be this: If it's good enough to be eaten, drank,
smoked, licked, or injected, it's good enough to be shot. Why waste
valuable research on developing ammunition when you can just stuff a can
of SoulStorm Brew into a BlitzPacker? And yeah, the BigBros can talk,
but of course they talk differently from the little sligs. Takes a lot
of testosterone and steroids to get them that big, after all.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why Did you call those Punk Rock looking Mudokons Tomahawkers?
What class are they? Are we going to know more info on them? They look
like My punk rock group. That would be so nice if Mudokons had their own
rock band:) :).

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They carry big Tomahawks, and they aren't the most imaginative
bunch when it comes to naming. Hence: Tomahawkers. And they tried to
make a band once, but they just got into a big fistfight over who got to
play drums.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Where does all the main game programming for Oddworld games take
place.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> At Oddworld Inhabitants, of course. The real question is where
all the de-programming happens... we still have a problem with the
coders getting kidnapped back by their families every so often. Then we
just gotta go out and brainwash another.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I am playing Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus, I'm at the very end just
about to jump through the bird portal that finishes the game but I've
missed 2 Mudokons I've only saved 298 not 300. I know I've missed them
In this last zone from the bit where I go to when "I reset path" to the
end, could you please, please, please tell me where they are or you will
have 2 less customers in your "Rehab and Tea".

PS: Where did you get that cool accent from I want one, I want one, I
want one, I want one, I want one, I want one.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Gee, that's incentive. Two fewer lushes hanging around and
being belligerent? Golly, I wouldn't want that. Well, I tell ya what. I
can't be sure which 2 you didn't save unless I know which ones you did
save... so tell me exactly where the other 298 were when you rescued
them, and I'll get back to ya.

As for the accent, eh, when I was in the brewery I was trying to suck
the last couple drops outta a bottle and got my tongue stuck in it for
about 4 days. I've talked kinda funny ever since.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I couldn't help noticing that in a recent batch of screenshots,
we see a SoBe beverage dispenser, complete with stylized text and SoBe
logo! Don't tell me that anti-corporate Oddworld has stooped to product
placement!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oddworld ain't anti-corporate, first of all. Oddworld's a
business, and just like any other, to make our product, we rely on
people buying them and then we use that money to pay the scrubs in the
pens to crank out code and art and design. Oddworld's opposed to certain
corporate practices, though... Environmental destruction, apathy towards
better health, animal experimentation, the likes. As it turns out, the
folks at SoBe are also a business that relies upon consumer dollars to
provide them with a product they want, and they also have similar
beliefs to our own.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I'm a Slig with some serious mental problems. I feel that the
slavery of Mudokons is wrong and should be paid at least! I have spoken
to my fellow Slig buddies but they think I'm mad or possessed!!! What
shall I do and what do you think about the Mudokon slave trade?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> ...What are those little lights floating around your head?
Abe, is that you in there? Doggonit, stop trying to mess with me when
I'm answering fan mail...
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I just wanted to know how Abe got that stupid sneaking motion! Is
it a habit or something? Was whoever thought of it having a hangover
when he/her thought of it?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Abe came up with that exaggerated sneaking motion during a
game of charades a couple years ago, and has just been kinda fond of it
ever since.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I may be in the neighborhood sometime soon, is it possible for
fans to come and visit the Oddworld Inhabitants?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> We're not exactly a hot spot of tourism... unless you have
some remarkably potent Scrab and Paramite repellant, are prepared to
gnaw your leg off on the off chance you happen to step into a Gabbit
trap, and all just to get a loincloth that says "I was very nearly rent
to shreds by a flock of hungry red bug-looking things and all I got was
this lousy loincloth."
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was wondering, why is Abe's eyes a bright orangey-red while
everybody else's eyes are a pearly white? Has he got some version of
pink eye? (and if he does, why doesn't he use eyedrops?). Also, why, in
your picture, do you look so dazed and glassy-eyed? Have you been
smoking something?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Why is his skin blue and the rest of ours green? Why are his
lips stitched shut? There are some things we just weren't meant to
know... yet. And if you're asking why I look dazed and glassy-eyed, you
haven't done your homework.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I am particularly excited about the new Oddworld game, but I have
one worry. I know that Oddworld is now advertising for a soft drink
company, there won't be any references to this in the game will there?
No blatant advertisement? I have seen games like this, sometimes they
pull it off, sometimes it comes off as blatant advertisement. Which one
will you be?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You are likely referring to the product tie-in that Oddworld
has with SOBE BEVERAGES, makers of fine, refreshing drinks. Rest assured
that Oddworld would never subject itself to unneeded advertising, even
for a splendid company which makes such quality products as SOBE
BEVERAGES. Don't worry about it...instead, go and have yourself a drink
to ease your stress...why not a delicious Elixir or Lizard Lightning
made by SOBE BEVERAGES?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was wondering, don't you and your mates get cold at all , I
mean since all you have to wear is identical clothes? Isn't there a
fashion industry or something?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> We Mudokons tend to hang about in arid regions, and our
loincloths, in addition to being sexy as all get-out, make for
comfortable living in such a climate.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Are Sligs really evil or are they just following orders?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Is Eddie Haskell evil? Sligs just gotta survive. They are
easily influence by their surroundings. Evil breeds evil.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How come Sligs can't jump even when you chant one?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Given the shoddy manufacturing, it's amazing Sligs can even
stay upright in their mechanical pants, let alone attempt to get
athletic in them.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> There's been something bothering me for a while now. Technically,
a Slig is about half critter, half machine right? What would be the
scenario if Abe possessed the Slig, and Munch Possessed the pants?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Put yourself in Munch's shoes. Would you want to plug your
mind into a Slig's pants?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How do Sligs turn into BigBro Sligs? Do they have this muscle
builder fluid or what?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> For a while they tried pumping iron and eating lots of
high-protien foods and buying those Nordic-Track things that are
advertised at 3AM on cable. Then, inevitably, a Vykker came along with
an invasive, destructive steroid that got the same results at a fraction
of the cost. And the rest is history, albeit history that seems to be
repeated quite frequently.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> My friend said that in Oddworld you can walk around doing nothing
and slapping people continuously, is that true?????

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Heck, you can do that in your world if I'm not mistaken ...
just don't make any plans for the afternoon that you can't accomplish in
a body cast.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Yo Alf, why don't Interns have mouths, I mean what if something
goes wrong and they need to talk. It's weird!!!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They do have mouths. Or did, anyway. Let's just say that
stitching technology has come a long way since they slapped those loose
bindings on Abe's lips.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey, would you happen to know why Scrabs have calf muscles? I
mean, their feet are just fixed spikes, so it seems like any contraction
of the calf would fail to serve any purpose... Actuator muscles,
maybe?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You're talkin' to the wrong guy on this one. As far as I'm
concerned about Scrabs, they see you, they start moving. Whether they do
this via superfluous calf muscles or rocket engines, it's all the same
to me, 'cause I am outta there.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Secondly, how can you reply to these E-mails if you are part of a
race with no idea of electronic devices?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> What's E-mail? I get these notes on paramiteskin parchments,
and that's how I answer them. No true slig would write any letter that
didn't involve killing something.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> And finally, will Crig the Slig be in the Quintology?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I have hopes, but there is a strong pro-mudokon bias working
against me. I try to explain to them the true nobility of sligly
viciousness, but they just don't understand.

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Hey Alf, what are the blue fish-like things the gabbits are eating
at the beginning of Munch's Oddysee? Could you tell me anything
interesting about them?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They are called Worryfish, and you have to be a slippery fella
like them Gabbits to catch one. They enjoy swimming around in schools. I
guess if I had to walk around with my school, I'd worry too.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Ok I've just sent SoulStorm Brew to it's demise, and I also (after
my hand blisters stopped bleeding) saved 300 Muds from the slave life,
after watching the ending sequence it is to my understandin' that Abe
should find out something about his mother when he is to meet Munch. The
thing is I've also destroyed Vykker's Lab and saved labor eggs and
Gabbiar! I dont think I heard or saw any regards or significents to
Abe's old lady! Either it's not there or I'm not payin attenion, so tell
me, dude, whats up with that?

SUB QUESTION!!!: Since Abe's Exoddus is a special bonus game, does
that mean we still can look foward to 3 other games in the quintology?
or just two?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Once you find the eggs, you're hot on the trail to where they
came from. Sometimes the first clues can be pretty unspectacular, but
they sometimes the most important. Hang in there, Buckaroo.

The powers that be may indeed give up 3 more games -- but believe me,
the Oddworld Universe is larger than maybe even three games can contain!
No one can contain me, alone! I will not go! Oh no! Sorry, pal! Not
going! Nuh-uh! I .... huh? What?

Oh. Ahem.

Yea, I dunno -- let's watch.
</p>

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi all you Muds! I have a little question for Abe. How many years
did you worked as a slave at RuptureFarms?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I'll answer for Abe. Way too many. He was trained since he was
a little meddling Mudling to do the stuff at RuptureFarms, so it's all
been a bit of a blur.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How come scrabs are found in herds in Munch's Oddysee and scrabs
are supposed to REALLY HATE EACH OTHER (that's what saves me in Abe's
Oddysee from these Slick creatures!! :) )

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> One on one, they can be confrontational. But in one big
group, they tend to get along, and just go with the crowd. Y'know, like
people in general.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi my name is Robert and I have been an Oddworld fan since Abe's
Oddysee. Can you tell me why Abe's voice is different in Abe's Exoddus
to what it was in Abe's Oddysee? I'm getting the XBox and Munch's
Oddysee in March when it is released here in Australia, but what voice
will Abe have this time?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Abe changes as the years go by, and it reflects in his voice.
Eventually, it reflects in the mirror. That's why I don't have any,
myself. Who needs to see your ponytail turning grey? Next question.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Can you tell me a cool thing about some creature of Oddworld that
I don't know about. Just telling ya I know a lot about Oddworld. I got
every question right on an Oddworld Trivia.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I happen to love dancing.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I've seen a picture of these two hideous old looking Vykkers,
(Not like they are all not hideous) but they are friggin' ugly. They
also always stand by facing their backs facing each other. They're
purple. They seem to be like the head Vykkers. Anyway, I would just like
to know what their names are.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Their names are Humphrey (the scientist) and Irwin, his ...
friend. If they have friends. These guys are so ugly, they could scare
the pants off of a Slig. I personally like it when they face away from
me because then I don't have to see their ugly mugs. Bleagh.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, I was wonderin' which guy are you in A.E. I know you
were one of the dudes who went with Abe on that journey, and then you
got sick from brew, and Abe has to cure you yadayadayada. So are you the
guy with the high pitched voice, or the guy with the throat that sounds
like there is a frog in it, or whooo???? Which guy are you I need to
know???? SEE YA WOULDN'T WANNA BE YA!:-)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I am the man. The A-number one man, the one, the only, the
Alf. That's who I am.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why stick with Elum when you could have a cute slog ! Even though
you claim that chicks dig Elum...I like Slogs so much beter! there Cute
and...Cute and you just wanna hug em ! so why not trade in Elum and get
a cute Sloggie...or one of those things...you know..there fuzzles but
they look like rabbits with three eyes, what are they? anyways, thats
all...so bye !

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The thingies you are referring to are Meeps, and perfectly
huggable. Lemme tell you something: If you want to make it to old age
with your face intact, you don't wanna get friendly with a Slog! They
make buzzsaws look cuddly. If you try to pet them, you'll wind up
feeding them. They are trouble with a capital "T". Which brings me to my
next question...
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What exactly is your TEA made of?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Goodness from nature, wholesomeness from the earth, and a
sprig of springwater for that right touch of 'liquid'.

And then sometimes I just grab a handful of leaves.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> O Alf, I just played the Oddworld demo and when Abe climbed this
long pillar thing he more or less walked up it. It looked like some
cartoon. Why doesn't he just climb regularly?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I've tried to get him to climb, but, dag-nabbit, that fellow
is just as shy about certain things as when I met him! If he doesn't
wanna climb, he ain't gonna climb!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hiyas Alf. Well done to your great success! I have a few
questions: Why don't the sligs all gang up on the glukkons, theres
enough of them aren't there?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They would have to be able to be smart enough to band
together- they're not. Plus, the Glukkons keep all the power to the
Slig's pants. Good luck doing a revolution as a slug.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What's Aslik the Vice-President of?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Some blown-up part of Feeco Depot. I think the crispy section.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> This one is from my friend. Why does Phleg look fat? (ridiculous
question I know!). Also could you say hi to Phleg for my other friend
who's crazy about him! And say hi to Aslik for me, i think hes kinda
cute.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> 'Cause he is.

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Dear Alf, I was wondering if you had a spare Abe's Oddysee game
lying around that you could send me for around $10. Please get back to
me. From T

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oh well, sure! Let me just wrap that right up for you, and
then stick a big sign in my head that says "Convenience Store"! Then I
can open up a Snow-cone machine in my ear, a gas station in my shorts,
and I'll become a flip-flappin' Convenience Store! Please, allow me to
be your personal hookup for whatever you can possibly sponge off of me -
I live for it! Forget that I'm just a guy that ANSWERS QUESTIONS!
Sheesh.

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hi, I'm a very big fan with a pc and have heard rumors that Munch
will only be on Xbox... is this true? I have the other two games and was
looking forward to seeing abe in 3d but if the rumors are true that will
never happen, PLEASE reply as soon as you can, I have already asked this
question to a different oddworld e-mail address but they have not
replied (maybe they are really busy)Huge fan, Andrea

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, the Oddworld folk are busy folk, and for now, the Xbox
suits our world just right. Would you want us to be carried on a system
that doesn't do us justice? Doesn't show the true brilliance of the
Oddworld world? Show how the Sligs can chase you and beat your behind as
well as they do? Me thinks not!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why don't you have any facts on Shrykulls? I saw something about a
Sea Rex and a Rat and I was wondering why they disappeared and what they
were.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Shrykulls are mysterious beings, that have hardly been caught
and studied-they are weird mystical creatures that scare the heck outta
me. When one comes in and offers its mitts to us and want to have tea
and tell us all about it, well, I'm all ears. But have you seen those
things? Yipes.

Sea Rexes and rats are ugly little creatures that make my skin crawl.
Sea Rexes swallow me, my shop, and all my precious text in one gulp, so
that's why I'm glad to stay on the shore and be happily ignorant of
them.

Ask me about meeps—they are pretty approachable.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Wuzz up Alf. Name's Cat, Digital game master. But this time I've
got a couple of Q's for youz.

Did Abe marry Sam the Mudokon queen ? If so was he insanely in love?
or was he just plain confused from his little fantasies ? Oh yeah one
more, Did you always looked that fine in your pictures ?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I am the Mack who packs a smack, dishing' out the phat flavah
for here and the future.

Now that we're done with the 70's B-movie talk, let's get down to
business.

I don't think Abe married Sam, since she's just downright nasty. Abe
isn't insanely in love, but he is a little dopey. He's also a bit of an
individualist, ready for whatever and whenever. Hardly a guy who's going
to slow down.

Did I always look that fine? Lady, I'm nice-fine like rice wine.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I have a few questions that I think need to be asked. or not. but
still, I wanna ask them. Well here I go. First question, when will you
have your own game? Ya know, something like "Alf's Rehab Oddysee" or
"Alf's Tea Exoddus", you could like smash sligs
with...uh...well...Tea....yeah! Acidic Tea Bombs and stuff.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hey! Yea! Now you're talking! I can see the hero (me) of the
world, with a quest for someone to save the people (me), in a world full
of rewards (for me!). Lessee ... if I see a billion bejillion copies....
and keep the royalties... carry the seven... WOW!

Kid, I like your style.

Second Question: how old are ya? like 20 something?

</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey ya all U Muds! No offense Alf Ur cool and all, but Abe is my
favorite character and I'd like him to answer, it's one only he could
answer anyway...What was Ur first thought and feelings when U first was
told U had to save Ur fellow Mudokons from Rupture Farms after U just
escaped from it and also when U successed and got praise for a hero?
Well that's all for now. See ya Abe

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Ur? What is this "Ur"? Am I some kind of ancient demigod with
two letters to his name? No, I have THREE letters in my name: "Alf." I
would love to speak to this "Ur" fellow and ask him your questions, but
I don't know him!

I don't speak in rebus—try the King's English, m'boy.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alfie, Got a big favor to ask. I love oddworld, and I love
video gaming. I think I might want a job in the field some day, but I
don't know how the system works. I'd like some pointers as to where I
should go to college if I aspire to be say... a conceptual artist. cuz,
I got no clue and I can't get answers from NOBODY in big business.
You're my last hope alfie man.  Always a fan, Erin

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Go check on a place that you would like to work, and find out
what their requirements are. If they are a good place, they'll give you
the answers you seek. Also, be persistent, but be ready to do the work.
Most people just fall in love with the idea, then shy away when they
find out it's hard work, so good luck!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf! I'm wondering for already a while what Abe is doing in
the picture you posted last month. Looks like he's rapping. What's it
all about, Alfie?  
Odd-Kissies from A Dutch girl.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> M.C. Abe is just striking a buffalo-stance pose, looking coy
and cool in his new washed loincloth! M.C. now means Mudokon Chillin'!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> To the no-dud Mud who's easy to love! Dear Alfie, Could you
please tell us more about your own admirable self? I would particularly
like to know about...

-   any childhood hardships
-   on-going saintliness (like your rehab work)
-   hobbies (like fly-fishing, dancing, playing in your band)

I trust in you, my beautiful and beloved Alf, to follow through as
always with your delicate, heart-filled responses... full of truth,
humor, and personality.

Thank you. From your adoring fan, Tybie

\[There's a lipstick smooch at the bottom.\]

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Tybie, your fannish-ness makes me go all wiggly. We couldn't
do it without all you fans! Getting in and out of the bathtub was
particularly hard for me, as I was very small. I also didn't like to eat
my veggies, but that was a long time ago.  
on-going saintliness (like your rehab work)

What can I say? I love people and to serve them nice hot tea. Don't
knock it until you try it! It's a lovely relaxing way to enjoy the day
and the evening, as the sun sets slowly in the West... uh, East...
whatever...

I like to drink tea, to walk about the place, and by gosh, I actually
like to answer these questions!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Yo Alf, Ur cool and all, but my favortie Character is Abe and I'd
like him to answer this one himself....It's one only he could answer
anyway.....What it's like when you possess someone? It must have been
weird the first time you did it. Plus judging by how you fell after
possessing Lulu and lost control sometimes it must be alot work. Also I
wanna say Ur the coolest character on Oddworld by far Abe....Well thanks
for your time and good luck on getting a break.....See ya

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Abe once told me that possession took a lot of concentration,
and sometimes that can be broken, when someone else is in the room,
distracting them. Or yelling at them, or whatever. That poor guy had a
roomful of squawking people, he had the pressure of saving the world,
and he had Munch yelling at him! I suppose possessing someone would feel
weird no matter HOW many times you'd done it.

I tell ya, that guy's got more heart than a King Scrab.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> O Alf, great fountain of wisdom and awe, I beg to you, answer
this question:  Is your formula, Ugly+$$$=Chicks, a branch-off of
Professor Alf Alpha's theory: Cute and/or Sexy+$$$=Lots of chicks?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Cute? Sexy? What's that? I'm a businessman. I like the peoples
as a whole. My formula for success is this:

Tea+Me= Happy Alf zzzz,

Tea+Me+Others= Cash flow. Happy Alf again!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> With the ever expanding Oddworld Universe that is visitable in
the games, are there any plans afoot to use a system (similar to that in
Seaman from Sega) wherebye speech recognition could be use to
communicate with the inhabitants of Oddworld. Maybe with the option to
set you own prefernces so instead of just saying "hello" to get
someone's attention you could instead say "hi" "oi" or "hey" etc...
Still looking forward to X-box's UK release, Dan J.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You can shake me up until a little blue triangle floats to the
top of my eyes that says "Unclear, ask again", but the truth is I can't
see the future. But take this to the bank: The future keeps coming, and
it does seem an interesting way to go...
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hello Alf. I've asked this before but you didn't answer it so
I'll try again... What has Crig the slig been doing the last few months?
I know that you are knowledgable enough not to need his help to answer
our questions but it was interesting to hear (and when I say hear I mean
read) a slig's points of view. I hope Crig hasn't died or anything, ever
since you introduced him I have wanted to learn more about him, his job
and his adventures (if he has any). Please tell me more about him.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Crig took a permanent vacation after barely escaping an
explosion at FeeCo. I think he's off somewhere tending a herd of Slogs
in the mountains, or he's punching tickets at a bumper-card ride
somewhere. I do believe we've heard the last form that boy.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> As I played the game called Munch's Oddysee I could turn Natives
into Tomahawkers and then into Mudarchers, but why couldn't Abe turn
into one of them?)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Abe is a truly unique character, he doesn't need to change
into anyone to get out of a situation. Look how far he's come with just
his wits! Stay with Abe, he's a survivor!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hello, Alf. my name is Tony, I'm from Brazil and I'm a fanatic
for the Abe games. I did play everyday, Abe's Exoddus and I would like
to know you will sell the next game "Munch's Oddysee" here in Brazil!
Congratulations for the game.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Thanks so much for the letter, Tony—we wouldn't be anything
without you fans! You truly make each day worth getting up... and
serving tea!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What's it all about, Alfie?

Is it just for the moment we live?

What's it all about,

When you sort it out, Alfie?

Are we meant to take more than we give?

.............(ok I forget the rest)............

Dear Alf: What's it all about? What's it all about, Alfie?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I would just blame it on Rio.

'Till next time, this is the number one Mud that ain't no dud -- so when
you have a question and need the direct line to information central,
don't forget to ask:

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Hi! I am a huge Oddworld fan and I love the games too they are
soooooooo cool! But I have a few questions here. Please answer!!! What
is the next Oddworld game and will it come to XBox?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The next Oddworld game is going to be "Alf Alf Saves The
Universe", and it's going to be starring yours truly, who runs around
for an hour or so, instantly defeating anything I touch. Well, it was an
idea I gave them—I haven't heard back, but my hopes are high.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is there going to be any new characters in the new game?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oy vey, I hope so. I hate to keep running from the same
Scrabs.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is Mollock really dead? If he is alive will he come to a new
Oddworld game?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> With these slimy types, you never know. I wouldn't buy it
unless I had him come up, shake my hand, and personally announce that
he's snuffed it. I wouldn't turn my back on him, otherwise.
KnowwhatImean? If he's alive, how else would you know?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Are the sligs or whatever builded RuptureFarms build it up
again?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I think that those sneaky so-and-so's would go and build
something completely different and new, since the Rupture Farms design
proved flawed and vulnerable. Why build the old place back up if all
it's going to do is blow up again? And kiddo, what's with the 'builded'?
Didn't you learnded nothing in school?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I'm a big fan of the Oddworld games and I've got a few questions.
What type of animal do the glukkons put mechanical masks, pants and wigs
on and call sligs?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Uh... those would be Sligs, boyo. Even without the mechanics,
it's still a Slig. And what do you mean 'wigs'? Did you see something I
didn't? I have yet to see a Slig cabaret.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do you have star ships or something, so you can go to other
planets?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Not just yet, but I have some tea that is absolutely out of
this world! Care to buy some? I have a special deal: Buy one, and I'll
give it to you! Howzat?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How come the glukkons don't just put anti-chant orbs
everywhere?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Time, money, laziness. Don't say it too loud, they might just
get an idea.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How come Abe seems to be the only Mudokon who can possess sligs,
glukkons, etc?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, Abe is who you currently run around as in the game-if
you ran around as another Mudokon, maybe you would be able to use their
powers. Also, let's remember that he's the leader and savior of the
race. I think that entitles him to one or two powers, hen?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf my names Robert and I have recently gotten Munch's
Oddysee. I noticed that when Abe or Munch drinks a can from a vend it
has a SoulStorm Brew Lable on it! You couldn't possibly tell me that Abe
or Munch is chuggin' down SoulStorm Brew to bring up their health or
make them run faster or jump higher could you?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No, I couldn't. Ya got me there. But I would like to address
something: What the heck is a "lable"? I've heard of Labels, and Ladels,
and even some Ukeleles, but never a lable. Could you tell me what a
lable is, if you're able?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi, Alf, It's me again!!! I just wanna ask you a question,
(again). Recently, I looked at the front cover of Munch's Oddysee. I
don't want to be rude, but Abe looks a bit different. I saw the marks on
his hand, that's obvious, the Paramite and Scrab marks from the Bigface.
But I noticed a mark on his chest. Could you tell me a little about that
please? If you could, that would be fantastic. (I will stay Odd)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> To get even with your Oddness, you've missed out on a whole
section of the previous game! In Abe's Exoddus, Abe was bestowed that
big chest mark by the three weirdoes in Necrum. It gave him some
wonderful powers, and that was the mark. What were you chugging Brew
while that part of the game was playing?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Are there any new Sligs or animals? I quite like sligs. They've
got Odditude!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> All the time! Our world is chocked full of goodness. Why we
gotcha Meeches, your Fleeches, your star-bellied Vykkers... ahem... and
you should be sure to stay abreast of all the animal kingdom of Odd by
staying abreast of the game. That means go get it. Now. Check out the
Universe section of this website too.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> On your first game, Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee, there was a cheat,
where you could look at any story that occured in the game. I preformed
it and went on a story called Guardian Angel. You know, the one with the
Shrink is talking to Abe. It was so cool, great job!!! But I was
somewhat puzzled when the Shrink said, "You've gotta look within, if ya
wanna be free!" Then you heard Abe cry for his life. What happened
man?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It scared him. A little. I mean, a big mechanical thing comes
down out of the ceiling, then you would probably be frightened too. But
since the old boy is still around, we can deduce that he's doing just
fine. That movie is actually a television commercial that was never
seen.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I am an avid fan of Oddworld I own the first 2 games in the
series and the replayability of the games is great I still play them all
the time.

Here's my beef though your company made the 3rd game in the series
only for the XBox, now I already own a PlayStation, a PlayStation 2, a
Dreamcast, and a Nintendo 64. So why should I the fan of Oddworld be
expected to go out and pay another $300 for a new system when I have 4
perfectly good ones at home one of which this game series started on why
can't you release Munch's Oddysee for PS2 as well instead of only on
XBox that would make a lot of us happy I am sure of it.

Well that was my question are there any plans in the future for it to
be released for PS2.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Beef? Your beef is nothing but bouill-ion! You've already
shelled out an un-oddly amount of moolah on four different consoles...
what's one more? Make your collection complete with an Xbox! Wow. Four
systems... you lucky gluk... uh I mean... duck....

Oh, and for the millionth time: The next four Oddworld games will be
exclusively for the Xbox.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How did Dripik lose his eye? And do you delete all the questions
that don't get screened or do you keep them all in a big Word file for
posterity?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The Muds down at the home office keep all the questions in a
big pile. I only get the ones that are dropped off monthly. As far as
Dripik losing his eye, I don't think he lost an eye; he's just too
stupid to realize he put the patch thing on.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I have a question. I've enjoyed all three games so far, but in
Munch's Oddysee, I noticed something strange about Abe. His eyes seem to
glow in the dark, and I'm sure I didn't see this in the previous games.
Since you're his friend, could you tell me if they have always been like
that? Or did something happen to him?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> He got a lot of tattoos, and a lot of powers... I think he may
be having more of the usual healthy little glow we all have. I mean, he
is the big Kahuna here on Oddworld. I guess it helps him see in the
dark.

<p><b>Question:</b> Hiya Alf!

I've been a fan of Oddworld for a while, and have been writing a few
questions too. From now on, I'm gonna call myself Oddguy, don't ask why
I just am. I'll give myself a made up name so you can know which
questions I write.

Anyway, I think those stupid glukkons should do some of the work, and
not just have the sligs do it for them while they sit on their big but.
I think there should be a flying Gluk, or something. A glukkon could be
in a flying harness like a flying slig and hold a gun or something. That
would be cool.

Anyway I played and beat Munch's Oddysee, and I want to know what to
expect in the next game. I heard it's called The Hand of Odd or
something. If you can't give me info on that then please tell me how the
industrialists took over the Mudokon and gabbit's lives. I heard that
Mudokons used to be the most powerful creatures on Oddworld. Then the
Glukkons took over. How? I want to hear the whole story in the
beginning.

An answer to both of my questions would be nice hehe.

Bye, Oddguy

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Glukkons are the ones in power—that's why they get to sit
around. I would say the Sligs should rise up and overthrow them myself,
but it doesn't seem to be in the cards, since the Sligs are as dumb as a
bag of hair.

The scumbag Glukkons came into power, because they didn't care WHO they
stepped on or WHAT they ruined to get there. Once you throw all your own
personal motives out there first, you wind up being a bad man, like
these Glukkon clowns! I say we put them all on a sligshot to Oddworld's
moon...

Also, the whole first game is based on the Glukkons taking power, maybe
you should give it a whirl first, and see if that answers any of your
questions. You can read about the history of Oddworld at 
[www.xbox.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20050205122123/http://www.xbox.com/news/0203/oddworldhistory.htm)
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf I have some questions for you. I would really like you
answer them because it would be annoying for both of us if I had to send
this to you over and over again until you finally gave me an answer. Why
doesn't your section in the Oddworld Universe have as much information
as Abe's or Munch's. You are just as interesting as both of them
combined?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sigh. I keep tellin' 'em at Oddworld about having an all-Alf
game, see above. Still waiting for that call back, y'all! I did make an
appearance in the new UYI video. Check out the images on top of this
page. Thanks for your support!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What are the names of the other continents on Oddworld (as of now
I only have heard of the one you live on, Mudos).

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Eh... so far, that's all I know myself. I don't travel much,
and I'm not quite the jumper I once was. I used to be able to run around
the house a couple of times and not even be tired! Of course, that's
when I was usually being chased by something...
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Have you ever eaten a Mudokon Pop? If so, what does your species
taste like?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Aw, c'mon. Did you ever have a people-steak? BLEAGH!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I just wanted to ask u a few questions , firstly I was wondering
why the creatures in Munch's Oddysee have become more humanized. the
glukkons talk like gangsters and the paramites like pigs and the scrabs
don't have their infamous shrieks like they used to in the previous
games. I thought the creatures of Oddworld were supposed to be nothing
like the things on earth? . I mean they look nothing like creatures here
but they sound like things from earth. can u tell me why??

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There are plenty of creatures that don't speak or make sense,
but it varies from adventure to adventure. I have yet to hear a fuzzle
make sense, or a fleech to give a speech! Hey, that's pretty good: To
hear a Fleech give a speech. Kinda like the earlier one fish two fish
thing. Maybe a got a knack for this kinda thing...
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What can you tell me about the queens Sam, Maggie and Skillya?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They are indeed queens of different species in Oddworld. We've
heard about them and seen images of them. Their stories have not been
told ... yet. Remember Oddworld is a big place!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Also do u have any information on the mudokon mother?? According
to all the info on some web sites and the Abe's Exoddus game she was
supposed to make an appearance in Munch's Oddysee but there was no sign
of her or the shrink?!

are any females of the respective species i.e. glukkons, vykkers etc
going to be shown in future games??

how come you didn't make an appearance in Munch's Oddysee, Alf??

also do u have any information on what a sea rex is??

and what a chronicler is??

is the planet Abe and the rest of them live on called Oddworld or is
there another name for it??

finally do u have any info on the next game or is another bonus game
likely?? There have been rumors about it being called Squeek's Oddysee,
is this true??

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Whoa, whoa WHOA! Too much at once! These questions were asked
before and the answer is the same: We can't reveal all the characters in
every game. The world is alarge place here on Oddworld, and the point
isn't to show you everyone in one game, but to have different adventures
that give a little here, a little there. If we show you all the same
characters every game, well, then it's not really a new adventure, is
it? We dole out the fun, equally each game, and some characters change
and evolve, others are new, and others have yet to be revealed. The
planet is Oddworld and we live in the continent of Mudos. Stay tuned for
the fun!

Well, that's all the news fit to print, I'm Alf and I'm out!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Every once in a while, while surfing the web for new tea
flavors, I accidentally end up in one of those crazy forums. I sort of
enjoy the Oddworld forums, but some of those other ones, they make me
feel funny.
</p>

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Helloooo Alf! I am your biggest fan of you, your tea, and your
wisdom. So, I've got a few questions for you, how the heck can you get
our e-mails if you don't live anywhere near our planet? Can you give me
some info on this "expresso" drink? (sounds like coffee to me!)
And,inspired by your greatness opened my own Tea shop with my own

sligs still have visors and flying sligs have two eyes why is that? -
Jason

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sneaky li'l devils! I would think their beady little eyes have
been modified to be better at flying, etc. Yuck. I can't even stand

</p>

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will the Meeches come out in any other Oddworld game? - Jonny
E.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Whaddaya mean? Onscreen? The way I remember it is that the
last box of Meech Munchies was shipped out of RuptureFarms during Abe's
Oddysee. The meeches are an instinct species as far as we know. At least
on the continent of Mudos that is.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I think its about time you guys told us a little about Munch's
Exoddus, like a story line or some new characters? - Justin

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Coming attractions?

...

This is the story of Abe, a geeky Mudokon who lives with his Aunt and
Uncle. A freak accident miraculously grants him incredible cool
insect-like abilities. Abe finds that there's a thin line between an
ordinary Mud and an extraordinary hero; and he'll have to be the one to
cross it. Stay tuned.

Molluck, is a sleep-deprived Glukkon detective tracking down a murderer,
but accidentally shoots his own partner.

Huh, I mean... it's an adventure of a wild and rambunctious mustang
stallion named Elum journeying through the untamed Mudos frontier...

Oops!

...

Agents J and K (Abe and Munch) are back for more battles with alien
rabble-rousers who take the form of a host of estrogen-charged
extraterrestrials.

Whaaa? The next game is set in mythic Middle Oddworld, a young mud named
Abe inherits a magic ring from his elderly cousin Alfo.

Take your pick!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Guten Tag Alf Sorry 'bout the foreign greeting, I was feeling
bilingual today, but on to the serious stuff. It's about Mud's hands.
They are huge compared to your bodies. I am willing to bet they weigh
twenty-five pounds, and could be used to club Glukkon's brains out. I
mean, they are giant. You could guide aircraft with them. I'm surprised
that you aren't weighed down with them. My question: Why? Why do you
need such abnormally large hands? -Kathleen

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> To cuddle my abnormally large fuzzle at night. Well, to club
something to death, you need a deadly attitude, things like that don't
come easy to us peace-lovin' mudokon folk. I would prefer that maybe we
just grab big bags of tea!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Can you please tell me a bit about those huge statues with the
tusks in Necrum. thanks nate\_dog

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The tusk statues are known as Guardians to the Mudokon
inhabitants. Legend has it, that at one point in Oddworld's history they
helped defend Necrum from invaders. However, all that is left of their
presence in the modern Oddworld record is their fossilized remains.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I have a mess of Slig related questions here!!!!!! Lets see if you
can answer some. 1. What is the name of the Slig valets name? is he the
dude who wears the dress?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The Emcee Slig.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Who is that cute Slig announcer? (call me crazy, but hey a girl
could have some fantasies too ya know! -oof

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Whoof. Well, his name is (strangely enough) Slig Announcer.
The reason these guys don't have personal names... well, they're trained
to be servile to the Glukkons—and you can't have individuality when
that's the case!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What's the average life span of a paramite and a scrab? -
Poltergiest

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It's really hard to get a hold of a paramite or a scrab for
study. And really, I think I speak for most Mudokons when I say that I'd
prefer a hot cup of tea to the scientific investigations of paramite and
scrab life expectancies any day. But since you bring it up, I once heard
a rumor of an alpha scrab that lived to be 80 years old!!! But maybe
that was the brew talkin'—you never know!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf! I'm Robert and I was wondering why Abe has two paramite
scars on his hands in Munch's Oddysee rather than one paramite scar and
one scrab scar? I would also like to know why Scrabs and paramites sound
different in Munch's Oddysee?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, as a close and personal friend of Abey's, I can tell you
for certain he's got no such scars! He uses a secret blend of herbs and
spooces to form a salve that cures all such ailments! The Scrab and
Paramite tattoos from Abe's Oddysee remain the same.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I suppose I'll start the normal way... I own all 3 games and they
r great. Outta this world, Oddworld is the best bunch of guys (and
girls) around!!! Danke! But... We want a fleech comeback!!! Would it be
possible for the fleeches in the sewer to get outta control and mutate
and take over the real world and develop advanced communicating stuff
and pose a new threat as flesh eating mutants and be weird and you get
the picture? Just wondering and thanx for your time. - Rod

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Eh... lemme think... is it possible? Yea.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Yo Alf whazzup, I just wanna know, at the end of Munch's Oddysee,
who put the bombs in Vykkers labs? Was it the Fuzzles, or Lulu, or who?
- Sean

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> YO! WhaaaatchDaMooooovieeeeee!!!!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hello Alf the Knowledgeable, what's up? How come Abe turns into a
bunch of birds whenever he is shot, crushed, ripped apart or blown up?
Is their some sort of symbiotic relationship between Mudokons and birds
that we don't know about? - The Radke's

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> We? No. More psychology, less biology, my logic-infested fan!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, I was wondering if Mudokons change their skin color to
show their emotions at will or if it just happens when they get moody?
For example: When an angry mudokon turns red does he do it on purpose to
tell others to stay away or does it happen on its own? If you can change
color at will, why is the common color green and why do the mudarchers
and tomahawkers turn white? - The Radke's

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> LESS BIOLOGY, MORE COSMETOLOGY!!!!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf. I had some nagging thoughts in the back of my mind, so I
thought I'd give them to you. Hey y'all: Why have you classified the
Raisin as 'wildlife'? I mean, he was born in North Mudos, doesn't that
make him native? - nare k

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Can't you understand? It doesn't matter what side of Mudos
you're born on. Everyone has their own special abilities and traits that
make them special. Like narcolepsy. And... being all wrinkly. And
incredibly... Large.. and fruity.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What's going on in that Meep Herder Village? Every time I kill a
Meep, it just springs back to life again. Not that I'd want to kill
them. Anyway, what tricks are those shepherds up to? Help me out here.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It seems that someone or something on Oddworld has taken an
affinity to protecting the Meep. Much in the same way Abe and Munch are
brought back to life after dying the Meep are brought back to life too.
The whole thing is quite a testament to the survival skills and
fortitude of our little furry friends.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Oh yeah, Alf, where do you keep disappearing off to? You're with
Abe in the Raisin's Cave, you're there again when you push him into the
Big Well. Why can't you help your buddy instead of rushing off like
that? No wonder you haven't got your own game, you keep chickening out.
Still, that's all from Max, I'll catch ya later.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Chickening out? Whatever! You gotta understand, that when a
guy drinks as much tea as I do, well, when you gotta "go", you gotta
go!!!!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What is the story or meaning behind the two little fetuses in the
OW logo? -Xavier

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The twin fetuses have long since been absorbed into Oddworld
lore. The caliper and test-tube motif for the Oddworld logo was created
for a brochure for the 1999 E3 convention. At the time, we were working
on two games simultaneously; Munch's Oddysee and Hand of Odd. As time
went on and the gears of corporate commerce kept turning, Hand of Odd
faded away and Munch's Oddysee became the sole focus of production. In
the end, Oddworld gave birth to a kicking and screaming Munch's Oddysee
only. This is the history of the twin fetuses.

'Till next time, this is the number one Mud that ain't no dud -- so when
you have ONE question and need the direct line to information central,
don't forget to ask:  
What's it all about, Alfie?

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: I love all the artwork and renders on the site and in the games,
does Oddworld have any plans to bring out an art book? I know several
people who would buy one instantly!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> But do you know anyonebesides the mothers of the OW staff that
would buy one, too?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I have always wondered why Abenever cut the stitches from his
mouth? I mean I can understand in Abe's Oddysee but after he got out of
RuptureFarms why didn't he get someone to give him the snip?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Abe says the stitches are both a reminder and a badge of honor.
Me, I think he's been hit in the head too much.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I have been reading through fact files of Abe, and it says he has
no...manhood. HOWEVER, in Abe's Exoddus, when he is shot out of the
mines, he lands on a kind of pole. He acts as though he busted his
u-know-what. Why???

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It's not the size; it's the motion.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> And since Abe has no sexual organs, does it mean Abe isn't male or
female? Why does Abe wear a loincloth then?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Because otherwise, he couldn't justify wearing a belt.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What I actually want to know is what part of your odd universe will
become open to us in Munch's Oddysee?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> In Munch's Oddysee you're going to be seeing a lot of the
Vykkers and their weird way of doing business. While the Glukkons were
the natural resource barons of Mudos, the Vykkers are the scientists and
doctors. The Vykkers have impeccable credentials, but are seriously
lacking in any spiritual wisdom. They're like those classic Harvard
PHD's that then go off to be vicious third world dictators or
researchers for tobacco companies.

Geographically speaking, the Oddworld Quintology takes place in the
territory of Mudos. As we get closer to the end of the Quintology we get
closer and closer to the heart of consumerism; which means the more
densely populated areas of Mudos. For Munch's Oddysee we'll be visiting
several places that we've yet to see before. Many of which are various
types of factories scattered across the landscape.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Please.. gimme more info on the species of Oddworld (the ones
coming out in Munch's Oddysee). Oddworld Inhabitants still haven't
filled the 'Oddworld Universe' section up with ALL the characters. Like
Queen Maggie, Khanzumers, Queen Skillya & Interns.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, the Interns are these kinda dopey guys with heads shaped
like canoes. They file stuff, and kind of hover around. They're a
low-grade pain in the neck. The only thing I'll say about Queen Margaret
is that nobody—and I do mean NOBODY—calls her "Maggie" to her face. Not
more than once, anyways.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How many employees at Oddworld Inhabitants sold their soul to the
devil in exchange for this beauty?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> We've had a full team of programmers working on this engine for
a long time. It started with a tremendous amount of time being spent
designing it on paper and working with the game design team to make sure
we were building something truly special. We've also been working with
an out of house team of programmers that build core technology (not a
game company). When the game is fully running we'll be talking more
about this other team, but not before.

The images that you see are really a result of an extremely talented
real-time art team that is here at Oddworld. The databases that they've
built have, in many ways, driven part of what the technological
performances of the engine need to be. Always, the balance between art
and programming is critical. The best engine in the world can easily
look lousy if there are not creative artists building databases for it
and constantly trying to push the image quality.

The technology development for Munch's Oddysee is the backbone for many
games that Oddworld will build over the next several years. Squeek's
Oddysee will also benefit from this technology.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Fleeches have two heads, correct? And Slurgs eat Fleech dung,
right? So my question is, if Fleeches don't have an (ahem) anus, then
where does the excrement that the Slurgs eat come from? Does one head
puke, or what?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I sent a guy to find out, but he never came back. Tell you
what: if you get close enough to a Fleech to solve this one, let me
know.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Who is Squeek?What kind of creature is it? 

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I can't tell you. But I can give you a hint. It's nothing
you've seen before, and also nothing you haven't seen before. Nyah-nyah!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Can you tell us more about the Khanzumers?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sure! But we don't want to spoil the suprise and show much of
the characters (species) that have yet to appear in games.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Yo, in Oddworld do you guyz listen to music like rock or rap?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> We can't hear music over all the screaming.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> We were brave enough to visit RuptureFarms and feel the smell of
Paramite pies, enter SoulStorm Brewery and drink a brew made of bones.
What gourmet food or drink are we supposed to taste now?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The more games we get the scarier food or drinks become.
Sometimes reality is far more strange than fiction. Processed food is
definately one of these examples. We love using food as the backbone to
reveal the corruption and greed of some of the forces of Oddworld. It's
very reflective of what's happening today on earth.

For Munch's Oddysee there are a lot of new food items coming. There is
Gabbiar, which is a delicacy of Gabbit Eggs (Munch is a Gabbit), there
are Blitzpacker, Lungbuster, and Snuzi firearms... there are also
Stoggies (cigars) and other goodies. Many of these new products will be
in factories that you'll have to deal with in the game. But this time,
factories are something that are much more interactive than the
backdrops that they've been for us in the past. This time you'll be able
to load a factory up with workers (or empty it of workers) and get it to
actually start making goods and profit.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will a Meech ever be shown in Oddworld like a flashback or
anything?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I heard a rumor about a pack of Meeches being discovered on a
lost plateau, but the Glukkonsscooped 'em up and dumped 'em into one of
their hunting preserves. There may be more, but I'm not sure.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Does Shrykull appear in Munch's Oddysee?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oh, yes, and all sorts of other Mojo Mayhem, too!

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf here is a simple question, none of that hard biology
stuff ; ). When will we be able to see some more pictures of kinto
slaves and when will we get to learn more about them? Are they as
intelligent as you and the other mudokons or are they more primitive?
That's all. Hope it isn't to complicated for you. Thanks for all the
work and occasional effort you put into answering our questions.
—TheKhanzumer

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It's hard to say if the Kinto's are intelligent or not, as
their paranoia about things looming above their head sort of limits all
of their other abilities. It's pretty hard to enslave a race that
refuses to work in an area with say, a roof or trees or anything
overhead. The Glukkons pretty much abandoned the idea of exploiting them
when they found it would take an inkling of effort. But who knows, maybe
one day they'll get a burst of motivation and try it again.
</p>
</div>

<p><b>Question:</b> Hey there fellow chump! First of all, I'd really appreciate it if
you could answer my E-mail this time. I don't mean to sound rude. I know
you're a very busy Mud and all, but I've E-mailed four times now, with
different questions, and not one of 'em's been answered or posted on the
site. Plus, my parents are gonna get real pissed if I keep E-mailing
over and over without getting any result. I have a couple of questions,
along with suggestions on who to ask if your infinite wisdom for some
reason can't figure out the answer. So here goes.

1: I wanna know how Abe possesses things. Does he send some part of
his soul, mind or both out through the possession orb to his target? Or
does he just send new thoughts and opinions to his target? I got that
second one by the way, by watchin' the movie where Abe possesses Lulu
(right after he says to the Valet "No way. Where'd these idiots get that
crazy idea, I hate that fishy crap," about the Gabbiar) and then ya hear
these weird echoing whispers when Lulu's eyes start glowin' blue. If
your vast knowledge and superior Mudokon brain can't figure it out, ask
Abe, Bigface, the Rasin or even the Three Weirdos (they should be
experts on spirits and stuff, being spirits themselves) about it.

Speaking of controlling things...

2: How do Sligs control their mechanical pants? Does that cable
(coming out of the pants that's hooked up to the mask) plug into their
brains or something? Again if your genius can't work it out, ask Crig
the Slig

Thanks for your time, and may the Odd be with ya. —Andrew H.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yes, you are quite rude, and I think your parents would be
more upset at your terminology than with me not replying to your
Oddworld-shattering email. As for your questions, no one really knows
how they possess something, it just happens! I mean, you don't have to
be a gastroenterologist in order to belch, do ya? The same goes for the
pants. And if you don't like my answers, go ask the Raisin!!!!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I would like to know, since I haven't got no Xbox, WHY THE HECK
YOU'RE AFRAID OF SLOGGIES?! They are just little buggers you can easily
kick out of the way. How come you are afraid of em? —Jose

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> So young, so naive. Without the proper equipment, you can
never experience the utter terror a sloggie inflicts on its prey. And
without living here in Mudos, I fear you can never even come close to
the barking, slobber dripping, tongue slapping, teeth like razors
reality of what a Sloggie really is.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I have two questions:

1 when Abe dies why does he turn into a flock of birds?

2 when another inhabitant dies why does their body dissolve away?

thanks alot Alf from daz36

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You have much to learn about the spirit world, which cannot
be seen by you or I. Sometimes we just have to think of a way to
represent it as closely as we can. Even then, there is still much to be
interpreted. Go now, and meditate on this.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf! u know ur rehab and tea? We've all heard of the delicious
tea with its golden leaves... but what about the rehab? Do They nurse
sick soulstorm brew drinking mudokons? Or is it just for mudokons who've
had too much tea? Also, is there a killing bonus in Abe's Exoddus if u
kill all nearly all da mudokons? Not that I would do that. I just want
to confirm rumours. THANX ALF luv NIC XXXX

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Too much tea? There is no such thing! And for the record,
killing one Mudokon is killing one too many!!!!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi do u remember me I'm Kaled from Egypt I'm sorry for late my
answer about your mail because I'm was busy in school. but I ask you
when Munch's Exoddus finished? and please answer this question. your
Kaled from Egypt

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hi Kaled, Munch's Exoddus? Is Munch going somewhere? Where is
he going? Do you think he'll stop by for tea? I should fix this place up
if he's coming by! There are used tea bags everywhere! I've got to
go!!!!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Alf- I've been working hard at getting the next to impossible
Black Quarma (I have an evil side) How in the heck am I supposed to pass
the first level with Munch without saving a fuzzle! the Crawdaddy

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Skill. Reflexes. Hand-eye coordination. Determination.
Opposable thumbs. You get the picture.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Two months ago somebody asked if you have ever eaten a Mudokon
Pop. You said that's disgusting. You're absolutely right, but you DID
drink Soulstorm Brew. And THAT'S made of MUDOKON BONES AND TEARS! What's
it all about Alfie??? —The Biggest Dutch Mudokon

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Dear Charell, Why you gotta go and bring up that horrible
business? It is true, the Glukkons tricked us into thinking that stuff
was so good, and we believed 'em, with their slick advertising and
chemical preservatives. Seemed good at the time; we didn't know! Thank
goodness for our buddy Abe, who saved us from that whole nasty mess.
Even by then we were so addicted it was downright hard to quit. That's
why I started the Rehab! Now if I could just kick the tea . . .
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, I was wondering: how come there's no Shrykull power in
Munch's Oddysee? I mean, you have got to be pulling Mudokon's arms out
of there sockets to get away with no Shrykull power. It was a great and
cool way to help Abe take out those Glukkons in RuptureFarms. And Abe
still has those hand scars and he just let them go to waste in this one.
So, why didn't Abe use the grand power of the Shrykull? It could have
come in useful in Vykker's Labs. —Colin

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Woa! Hey, there now! Let's not get carried away ... there's no
need to go pulling arms out of sockets just because you didn't get your
Shrykull fix in Munch's Oddysee. I think Abe just thought his other
skills were better suited this go 'round. I mean, we wouldn't want it to
be too easy on the poor bugger! Besides it's called Munch's Oddysee and
Abe didn't want to show up Munch.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do you have a release date for Munchs Exoddus because I have
finished Munchs Oddysee? Do you know if Shrink will return to the games
because his appearance in Abes Oddysee was very brief? —Shrykull

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Congratulations! You finished Munch's Oddysee! Now play it
again and quit asking so many questions!

P.S. Can you answer Colin's question? I think he's about to go nutso on
us

I hope the Shrink does return because, well, ahem... I think one of our
fans could use his help...
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do GLUKKONS have moolah if they don't yousit —Jose

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Dear Jose, NO! You sit! Why should I have to sit? Huh? Wha?
Oh, right ... GLUKKONS dew yous moolah, to bye smokes, sparkly soots,
and priceless food items like Gabbiar.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> yo Alf y can't mudokons pkup weapons form sligs? form your bast
bud sean

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It isn't a matter of can or cannot, but a matter of want or
not want. I'd much rather pick up a nice, warm steamin' cup 'o tea.
Ahhhh, now that sounds nice.

'Till next time, this is the number one Mud that ain't no dud -- so when
you have a question and need the direct line to information central,
don't forget to ask:  
What's it all about, Alfie?

<p><b>Question:</b> Q:  In the intern's groove music, what are the lyrics being
sung/chanted? — Nathan Alf Rocks!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> He rocks! He drinks tea, he answers silly questions, and...

He rocks!

Chorus

He Rocks!

Oh yeah, he rocks!

Alf Rocks!

Well, that's what I hear, anyway. You probably heard: "If you could save
my life I'd meet you at the lightpole, baby."
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I wanted to ask you why is it that only Abe can save the Mudokons
by chanting. — Harry

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> If you've found a method better than chanting, please, let us
know!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was walking around in the FeeCo Depot and I noticed a sign that
said Vykkers Lab coming soon! And since Vykkers Labs is a flying
fortress how could a train get there if it's in the sky? And how come
Shock Rockers were in the book thingy that comes with the game but not
in the game? — James.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sometimes things come soon to places other than where their
posters are hung. For example, if you were at your local drug store, and
they had a poster that said, "Bobo's Circus, coming soon!" You wouldn't
expect the circus to set up shop right there in the toiletries
department, would you? Don't be silly! And the ShockRockers... well,
their equipment was shoddy and they shocked themselves right out of the
game! Crazy!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I have all the Oddworld games, I check the website on a regular
basis and only one question has been gnawing at my mind like a hungry
fleech...

How do Mudarchers power their bows and do they ever run out of ammo?

Also, they need to bring you back in the game, even if it's just a
cameo.

One more question (sorry, it just popped in my head), what happened to
all those blind Mudokons? Could they get their sight back? I hope so. I
feel bad for that one who helped you put up your sign. Did his finger
heal ok?

Thanks for the time. Hope to hear from you soon. — Geoff

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Mudarchers power their bows with Spooce. And as you probably
know, if you run out of spooce, you can always grow some more!

I would love to dedicate some of my time to short film and/or gameplay,
but I find that the rehab keeps me quite busy. My Brethren need me!

As for the poor blind folk: If they did get their stitches snipped,
their poor eyes would never adjust to the light after being closed so
long. It's a shame. Better to be blind and free than blind and a food
product, though!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I 'd like to know what Mudokon clothes are made of. I 've seen
meeps so you obviously have wool. But you don't seem to be wearing any
wool clothing so what other fabrics are your clothes made of? — Kleeng

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I don't know if meeps give "wool", though they may contribute
to the textile production process ... at the fertilizer level. Various
plants are used to create our light, comfortable and stylish loincloths.
They are handcrafted by Mudokons who don't have to spend all of their
time answering questions about interplanetary fashion!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf! My name is Robert and I have a question for you. Do
fuzzles have a queen?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hi Robert! I've never seen a Fuzzle queen, but I've never
seen any of the other queens, either. Most creatures on Oddworld are
descended from a queen, so it is safe to say ... Probably.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Since Glukkons only have vestigial stubs for legs and walk on
their hands, I just have to wonder ... What happened to the Glukkons'
legs? And does having hands in your shoes make your shoes smell as much
as having feet in them does? Thanks a bunch! — Jon

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well Jon, when your species doesn't use something, generation
after generation, it degenerates to a pathetic, good for nothing stub.
You know: use it or lose it! And I don't know about having your hands in
your shoes, but I do know that everything about a Glukkon STINKS!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi, how are you? I don't know where I've read about Abe's
fingers, I was just reading the website. I want to ask you, how do you
perform the games? Have all of you studied computation or you are a team
of musicians, drawers, computer designer etc? — Facundo

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I'm tea-riffic! Oddworld has Production Artists, Modelers,
Animators, Real-time Artists, Programmers, a Sound Designer/Composer,
Technical Support and an Administration staff that all work together on
the games. Not to mention the kind upper management, who have never once
threatened to sew anyone's eyes or mouths shut! Isn't that sweet? Just
one more benefit of being an Oddworld Employee!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf I just wanted to ask you a simple little question. It is
said that the true evil of Oddworld will be revealed. Does this mean
that the Glukkons and other Industrialist are not the bad guys? And if
so do you know who will be the true bad guys? Or will there even be a
bad guy as some of us think. I hope this question wont force you to
reveal much. But I am curious. — Kaimana

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Kaimana, you should know by now that you can't force Alfie to
do much of anything! In general when people refer to "true" evil, it is
usually what's considered most evil of all, or the source of all evils.
Glukkons and Industrialists are bad guys, but someone or something
causes them to be that way, right?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> When is oddworld 4 coming out, what is its name, and what system
is it coming out for. — Matt

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oddworld 4, codename "Oddworld 4", will be coming out sometime
in the future. Only on Xbox!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf! My name is Robert and I would like some info on Mudflubs
and Khanzumerz please.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hi Robert! I would love to give you some info on Mudflubs and
Khanzumerz, but they are folks whose stories are still in the making. It
would be like writing the biography of a three-year-old. Sometimes
characters are released, but then don't make it into the games, and fans
such as yourself are let down because they've heard or seen something
about them. Which is why you won't be hearing ANYTHING about Oddworld 4
until the time is right! Sorry, bud!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf what is it like to ride an Elum?????????? — Brad

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Stinky, sweaty, bumpy. All the things one looks for in
affordable transportation. Comparable in your world to "Public Transit".
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf I' ve been wondering, if Mudokons don't use moolah why
does Sam (Mudokon Queen) give her eggs away to Glukkons or do they offer
it but she doesn't except it. Thanks alot, Daz36.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, neither! She doesn't give them away, but what she gets
in return is not moolah. Let's just say that in addition to other
things, her employee benefits offer an outstanding prescription drug
plan.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I've got another question to ask you Alf. In your first two games
Scrabs were extremely territorial but in the third they don't fight at
all. What's up with that! -Jason

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, I've never gotten close enough to a scrab to ask him,
but they seem to be much less hostile in the outdoors. Captivity does
something to a creature, you know? Makes every inch of space more
valuable.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Seriously Alf, convince the guys to make the rest of the Oddworld
games for the PC. You will make more moolah! That means more teabags in
your storage and more room for ya guests.

Plus you make alot of people happy in a way even your tea canÕt do.
You can always break the silly Xbox exclusive, it only counts for Munch
ay?

Speaking of Exclusives... how can it be an exclusive to Xbox is munch
will be released for GBA(Game Boy Advance)..? \Sips Alf's tea... Do I
taste the faint taste of deodorant??\

— Dark Xinos (Forum guy)  PS. You should visit the forum more often
Alfie! We NEED you!!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Xinos, I cannot answer a man who faintly tastes deodorant. I
just can't. It is wrong, so very, very wrong. But I will visit the

<p><b>Question:</b> Q:  Dear Beloved Alf, I admire your generosity in answering your
fans' mail no matter how stupid the question. I have a question myself.
Are sligs distantly related to paramites? They've both got the "finger
things" around the mouth and are almost the same size. I know mentioning
sligs and paramites in the same sentence kind of degrades the paramites'
name but I've got to know!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yes, how observant of you to notice how generous I am!
Goodness I'm blushing! I am so overwhelmed by this moment we've had!
What a wonderful reminder of how, on one level or another, we are all
related. Hugs, anyone???
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hello Alf, If Scrabs fight and kill each other every time they
meet,how come they aren't extinct? Maybe they have some strange mating
ritual whilst fighting,maybe they reproduce alone or is there another
reason........Thanks for now........Long Live Abe !!! —Johnny Q.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yeah they fight a lot but they don't kill each other off every
time. It's when you get two dominant Scrabs together that's when it gets
REALLY ugly!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, What sort of things do you like to watch on TV? How many
channels do you guys get? I already know about Magog On the March
(M.O.M.) and FUD Network, but what else do you guys like to watch on the
tube? Also, what is the deal with that article in the Daily Deception?
The one about you slapping people? Thanks, Khanz

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I know that I am a celebrity, and that by dedicating my life
to tea and rehabilitation I automatically put myself "out there" in the
public eye, but this has gone too far! The tabloids, the intrusive
questioning! Underneath the glamour I am just a Mud like everyone else!
Why doesn't anyone understand that?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Alf Man! As there are so many Wanted Posters of Abe and Munch,
could you, Buddy, Abe, or Munch get some for us loyal fans? And, how
come some Mudokons have more feathers than others? Great Site by the
way. Thanks, toddmann. p.s. Really Great site.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Todd Man! Thanks! There aren't as many wanted posters as you'd
think. They gave Abe and Munch a funny feeling, so they pretty much tear
'em up whenever they see one. The feather question is simply a result of
a traditional supply and demand scenario.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I forgot to mention in my other letter, in Munch's Odysee, the
good ending, When Lulu is betting or about to, a lot of clapping is
going on. I understand they wanna clap but how!? Glukkons dont have arms
and the Vykkers looked to be less then 1/3 of the bidders. Alright
then... good luck with your tea.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Not entirely true. Though shamefully tiny, useless and
hidden, Glukkons DO have arms and hands. Also, Vykkers have double the
appendages of the average Inhabitant, AND they are fierce clappers. But
you know, it wouldn't surprise me if they invented some sort of clapping
amplifier to make others believe that they are even better at it than
they really are. Showoffs!!!

The Weirdo and Mud Worshiper —Cody

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hi Cody. Try getting good Quarma. I think this will solve
your problem, as the essence of Quarma is "what comes around, goes
around," to put it in a Fuzzle's perspective. Besides, wouldn't you be a
little vindictive if your buddies left you to suffer in Vykker's Lab?
</p>

And do u feel sorry for sligs because they've been neglected by skillya?
Also 1 more thing, has a scrab attacked u ? stay odd —Declan

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I hear the sligs have great systems admin, and keep up on all
the latest technology, hence the upgrade in face masks. Do I feel sorry
for the them? Puh-leaze. Where is Alf's mommy? What about my needs? Does
anyone feel sorry for me? NO! And to wrap up, a reality check: Had I
been attacked by a scrab I would be in that big Rehab in the sky, not
down here doin' dis!

<p><b>Question:</b> What customers have you had lately?did elum come to your shop to
have honey in his tea? And is their anyone else on Oddworld I can e
mail? —Brad

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hi Brad. Yes, Elum likes to stop by, but more for honey than

Sligs!! They were some of the greatest things I think, but I have one
question: Will Elum or the Flying sligs ever return?? —the one who mix's
dish soap with his ice tea, Abe's Son

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, those ideas got used. Now there are new ideas!
Wassamatta? You don't like new ideas? You think it's ok for you to think
of new ideas (i.e. mixing dish soap w/ice tea) but we're supposed to
just keep doing the same thing over and over?! Maybe you should try your
tea with a dash of Hypocrite! Or a twist of Infidel! Maybe a dollop of
Deceiver! Or just a touch of Blasphemer!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, I'm a big fan of Oddworld (Arn't we all) and i'd like to
ask you the following questions:

1. In Abe's Oddysee do the Sligs have a mask with one red bar for
thier eyes and in the second and third they have two red eye goggles on
each side of their head.Why is this?

2. In the movie sequences in Abe's Exoddus the Sligs have two red eye
goggles on their masks but in the game it's self they have only one bar.
Why is this?

3. Have any mudokons ever more than just slaves and employees in the
industrial world.

4. Could ya tell me what the Sligs masks are called as well because I
have no idea.

Thanx, Robbie

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> 1. Upgrades my man, upgrades. It takes the very best
technology to constantly maintain the level of sham that Sligs do.

2\. Hmmm. Think you're mistaken. Look again. Closer ... Closer ... is
your nose touching the screen? Get a little closer. Closer!

3\. No silly!!!!

4\. Sligs have been known to name their masks Fred, Bob, and Phyllis.
But they are generally referred to as "Slig Masks".

into all of this, what are some possibilities of future game names, etc.
I know you must get these kind of questions a lot, and they probably bug

<p><b>Question:</b> Hello Alf, I have been a big fan of the Oddworld games for a
while. I have the first two, I'm still savin' for an Xbox, but I have a
question for you. Why aren't there any female mudokons??? What the heck
did I miss??? Please clear this matter up for me. From Bryce

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Bryce, You didn't miss anything! Female Mudokons haven't been
seen in the Quintology. Us Muds are so in touch with our feminine side
we thought you'd be perfectly content with guys like me and Abe!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> If I want to start a fan Site do I have to get an OK from you?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Create your own Oddworld approved fansite you say? Well my
friend, just follow these three easy steps!

Make a fan website. Get pictures, text and ideas from the internet or
wherever.

Then send a link to your fabulous fan creation to fanlegal@oddworld.com.
(This way we can approve it and give you the proper disclaimers.)
VOILA!!! Your very own Oddworld fan website!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf!!! This will be a quick one since I have to go to school
soon. I was wondering, do Mudokons have noses? Can you guys smell
things? Like, when your really close to a filthy slig, could you say
they smell in a literall sense? Ok, thanks for your time, Alf! Talk ta
ya latta. SLIGcatcher

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well I know for sure that Abe can make some pretty noxious
smells, so I guess that means we can smell things! Have fun at school!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> First off, where do the mudokon eggs come from? There were rumors
that Abe had to rescue his mother in Munch's Oddysee, but they never
showed her so I assume that he did anyway. But is Abe's mom the "Great
Mother" who was the only female in the game that bred the savior of all
the mudokons and the whole basic Mudokon life forms? I doubt that but if
there is a female population of Mudokons, I think that studying them
would reveal the secret to how the Mudokon eggs are made and how they
make them.

Anyway, can you just answer a couple of questions to sum this up, How
are Mudokons bred and what happened to the female population if there is
one?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You are a genius! Studying the female species could really
shed light on how Mudokon eggs are produced! Uh, gotta go, I need to get
out my little black book. \wink wink\ I'll get back to you, I have
some uh, research to do!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> In Munch's Oddysee, doesn't Munch break his leg in the trap? It
said that somewhere on the website. Anyway, if his leg was broken, how
come he hops around as soon as the fuzzles break him out of his bonds?
Love your games and website. Gobi the talented camel.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The Vykker's mended his broken leg. Those snaggle toothed
freaks got him in tip-top condition so he could lead them to more
pharmaceutical fodder. Vykkers become very kind and generous when it
comes to the bottom line!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I love playing videogames with my buds all the time. My mom
thinks I should get outside once in awhile and get a life. She's
threatened to take away my Xbox. I don't know what to do cuz I love
videogames so much. I know you love 'em too. I don't care about girls
cuz they are all thumbs. What should I do Alf? Your pal Ryan.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Ryan, that whole "outside" and "life" junk is completely
overrated. I stopped drinking tea once to check out some other
interests. You know, brew drinkin', stuff like that. BO-ring! Now I'm
back in my routine and happy as ratz in a biohazard container!
Yeee-hooo, boy! Perhaps a new hairstyle or wig is a better answer to
your need for change.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Heya Alf, I luv Oddworld! I'm obsessed by anything ODD! I'm
thinkin of getting an Odd tattoo on my back. My wife and kids say I'll
regret it but I love Oddworld so much. Anything else I can do besides a
Tattoo? In Odd We Trust ... forever yours, Warren.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No way Warren, this idea is way out there. You should not even
consider this for another moment. You see, getting a tattoo is a big
step and will last forever. So why would you want one on your back? It
totally has to be on your belly, so that you can look down and see it
anytime ya want!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> If you could switch jobs with any other Mud, what would you do?
Thanx, Jen.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Tea brewing and chillin' with my buds is where my heart's at.
I wouldn't have it any other way!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, I have a theory. If you put females in your games then
more girls will play them. If more girls play games then boys can play
games with them. Make sense?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Huh. Never thought of that. I just always assumed girls wanted
to play as male characters, or as girls with genetically inconceivable
proportions. How 'bout if we just make gender-neutral characters with
boy names???
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I want to give my brother an Oddworld related gift for Hannukah.
I can't decide between the Paramite Pies, Scrab Cakes or Elum Chubs. Are
these items kosher? Thanks in advance, Mo.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Odd-vey! NO WAY! Don't be a schlemiel! Try a nice
matzo-sculpture of our buddy Elum instead. Or perhaps a few
spooce-shaped chocolates wrapped in gold foil! Kids these days, I tell
ya! Some of 'em I'd like ta kick in the tuchis!

'Till next time, this is the number one Mud that ain't no dud -- so when
you have a question and need the direct line to information central,
don't forget to ask Dear Alf!

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q:  Hey Alf, how come abe cannot turn into a shrykull all the time
but needs a special portal? Is it spooce?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Spooce it is not. There are just certain, rewarding moments in
life when Abe gets to take advantage of the shrykull. A tear in the
otherwise oppressive fabric of fairness, if you will.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Since the sligs caught the gabbits befor at the end of the game
what is going to stop them from catching the new baby gabbits again?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hmmmm. Sounds like a job for an unlikely hero to me!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, Sorry to bother ya but lately we have been discussing
Interns on the forums. I just wanted to brush up my knowledge on them,
with your help of course! ; ).

Ok, I just wanted to know why do Interns realy have thier mouth sewn
shut and feet, hoves, etc cut off? I also just wanted to know if Interns
were made for the Vykkers for personal use or have they always been what
they are today?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yes, interns really do have their mouths sewn shut. This is to
prevent them from whistling annoying techno and trance tunes while
working. Unfortunately, they can still email and surf the net.

They do also have hooves, this is hard to notice because they seem to be
the same size as their leg bones, unlike a horse or a pig, where the
hoof is semi-cone-shaped. Nothing's been cut off yet, but I'm not sayin'
it couldn't happen!

The interns weren't created, but like so many of the poor critters that
cross the threshold of Vykker's Labs, they've undergone slight
"mODDifications".
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> ALFY MY CHUM! I must ask a question of you, what ever became of
fleeches and greeters and slurgs, you guys did'nt put em in the third
game.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They are still fleeching, greeting, and slurging around
Oddworld, they just didn't make it into Munch's story. Better luck next
time, ay?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is Abe the only Mud with the power to open bird portals?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yes, Abe is special. But I have been known to open tea
canisters and sugar packets. Doesn't that count for anything?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why did the Glukkons choose Abe as an ad campaign, all Mud
product posters show blue skin, not the common green. Even Mudokon Pops
are blue!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Studies show that nine out of ten muds prefer the color blue,
especially in the edibles category. It's all about targeting your
market, bud.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why was Abe's mouth stapled shut? No other Muds in stapled have
this done to them.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Not stapled, stitched! Abe was a noisy, whiny, cry baby and
no one could stand his incessant blabber, so they sewed him up tight.
Not too tight to have a brew, though!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> In the bad Exoddus ending you cannot see Abe's feet when he is in
the tear extractor, but when you see Muds in the game you can easily see
their feet. Also, why do their loin-clothes stay on their legs?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> What the heck are you talking about? That isn't even a
question. I'm sorry that you can't see Abe's feet. There. Are you happy
now? And the loincloths happen to be heavily starched, OK? Every good,
upstanding citizen of Mudos knows that a well starched Mudokon is a
happy Mudokon.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf how is it going in the world of odd? And how is your tea
coming? My name is Dave and I am a huge Oddworld fanatic. I pretty much
love Oddworld so much I am a member of the Oddworld forums. Ok enough
with the pointless talking. I have these two iching questions and I need
your answer. How big is a Sea Rex? And will we see them in future
games?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well things would be better if people made sense, but I don't
want to ask too much of the human race.

ANYWAY, here's some soothing ointment for your itch: It is very
difficult to determine the size of a sea rex because they are constantly
undulating through the water, and are never lain out straight next to
another critter where you could make some kind of a comparison. I just
know they're big, cause no one wants to catch 'em ... either that or
they just taste bad! They're probably the largest animal I know of on
Oddworld, though!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Alfy baby, Ya cool by me you're actually one a my favorite
characters and do the sligs despise the Glukkons even though they
serve'em an' all?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They don't despise the glukkons, they probably aren't capable
of thinking enough to despise them. They do, however, have a natural
desire for the nurturing and attention that they were deprived of as
children. They are also easily impressed by status, and therefore I
would guess are highly susceptible to abusive relationships, such as
serving the Gluks.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I have one question that has been bothering me for a while. What
happened in the desert while travelling with Abe that the cameras didn't
show? Anything funny?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You mean when the thing was all whatever, and we all went
AAAAHHHH and then that one time when the hahahhahhaaaaaaaaaa! Man that
was so funny! And oh my gosh there was this one thing that was all
blabidyybalbllllaaaa! And we were like all, "Whoaaaaa!" That was like, I
don't even know what! I was just like, couldn't even believe that that
even happened! Dems good times, man, good times.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Has Munch started his colony of Gabbits yet? Or has his lungs
been stolen.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Colony starting is a far more complicated process than one
might expect. You can't just dump the eggs in the water, stir well,
rinse and repeat. These things typically take some time, so my guess is
that he's still in the planning stages.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> When do ya hope to kick off you merchandise? I sooooooooo want a
collection of posable action figures from oddworld.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Wouldn't you rather save your money for things you really
need? Like books, wholesome vegetables, and a warm winter coat?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, me again. I was wondering: where does Abe go when he's
not out possesing Sligs or blowing up boilers and stuff like that. I
mean, he must have a break in between his missions, right? So what does
he do? Does he hang with the Big Raisin in Raisin's Cave, does he chill
out with Big Face in Mosaic Lines, does he go drink some tea at your
Rehab and Tea? Thanks for your time.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Abe used to just sit around watching the tube and drinkin'
brew all day. Last I heard lately he's into hot yoga and soap making.
Saving your species brings many changes to a mud.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> And did Elum die ???

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Elum is a species, so the whole species did not die, no. But
alas, we did come to know and love Abe's Elum as far more than just a
mode of transport. He had an untimely ending on the RuptureFarms
chopping block. Unfortunately, Elums are known not only as good pack
animals, but also as a valuable commodity for Sloggy Chow and Elumer's
Glue.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Are fuzzles predators ??? (Cuz their teeth are so sharp)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Fuzzles are little sweety-pies that have been genetically
altered and are pretty peeved about it. Calling them a predator implies
that they victimize and destroy for their own personal gain, yet we saw
in Munch's Oddysee that they are perfectly willing to do that for the
good of others, as well! I'd say they're more passive aggressive than
predator.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I'm only wondering where's BigFace? I haven't seen him since Abe
left to Necrum Mines with his friends. Can we see him anymore?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, at the last sewing circle, I heard BigFace went to one
of those "stress reduction" spas, and no one has seen him in weeks! If
you ask me it's a flimsy coverup for a face job- you have no idea how
hard it is to live a name like "BigFace" down when that is exactly what
you have. I actually feel sorry for the chump. But you didn't hear it
from me!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What powers the slig's pants? oil? gasoline? batteries? Thanks...
Oddworld rocks!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Vykker's Pharmaceuticals is always looking for newer, cheaper,
more destructive ways to better serve the greedy. Fuel is from Magog
Motors.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Help, I've been using the Odd icons for the past two years, I
have now had my computer updated and have lost the icons. Are they still
available to download or are they lost forever???

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yes! Oddicons are back by popular demand. Check out the
downloads section of this site early 2003.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alfie, can you give me some info about Munch's Exoddus?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Uh, no! Check out the FAQ's will ya?

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q:  Hey Alf, Me and a few of the guys at The Forums are wondering
something, what Abes loin cloth for?? I know its been asked sometime
before, but Ive forgotten what you said. Someone actually thought that
it has some kind of spiritual significance, but I assured him that skid
marks would be the only out-of-the-ordinary thing about them, so we're
all kinda skeptical at the moment. Thanks if you help us out and we'll
see ya next time youre in chat....or something. —BigBro

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> BigBro, Even skid marks are highly unlikely with a loincloth,
as you should know, they don't have a traditional crotch like your
typical, modern-day undies. A loincloth is like a skirt, only without
the feminine stigma earth folk so often attribute to skirts. (Think
kilt.) The significance and purpose of the loincloth is both practical
and fashionable. One doesn't necessarily want his bum exposed to even
his closest of buddies, and it has been known to get pretty chilly at
times here in Mudos, so it is the most efficient way of keeping that
area warm while still providing necessary mobility for the active, "Mud
on the go".
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I just completed Munchs Oddysee for the third time this time I
rescued everything. I can't wait until the next game could you answer a
question for me, I found something on an oddworld fansite called
Humshrubs that look like spooce but are pink do you know what happened
to them? Are Slig Guard towers going to featured in future games? Thanks
Shrykull68

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> "Humshrub" was a work-in-progress name for Spooce. They were
later renamed and the color was changed. Why? Because! That's why!
That's also why you're not hearing too much about the next title. This
way it will all be a big surprise, with no confusion or let down about
what didn't make it into the game.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alfster! If it doesn't bother you, can you answer a few
questions

1. In the next game, will Munch be able to communicate with Gabbits?

2. Is "Hand of Odd" a quintology game, or a bonus game?

3. Will you ever become a playable Character? Your own game perhaps?

4. Is Vykker Labs part of the Magog Cartel?

5. Once O.I. is finished the O.Q., will your games move to more
multiplayer genres like racing, Fighting or even party?

Thanks a lot Bro. From Barnaby

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hey Barnaby, It always bothers me, but I'll get over it.

1\. Well, I don't know much about the next game, but since Munch IS a
Gabbit, I don't see any reason why he wouldn't be able to communicate
with them, unless that headport has affected his social skills in some
way...

2\. Hand of Odd is not yet.

3\. Sometimes it's better to be lovable than playable.

4\. OI finish the OQ? FYI - I think your IQ needs some TLC! TTFN!

<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf. I've this is gonna be the best Christmas ever,I got the
OWI x-mas card in the mail.that was cool.plus I sneaked a peek at what
I'm getting.so anyway, I was wondering, is the mudokon queen Sam ever
going to make an appearance?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yes. Though when, where and to whom has yet to be decided.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was just wondering if there is anything more powerful than a
Shrykull? Furthermore, do you know when (or if) there is going to be a
last game of Oddworld? (I hope not.) Your best fan, Dylan

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hi Dylan, nothing that I know of is more spiritually powerful
than a Shrykull. But it's like anything, the answer is limited to my
experience. There may be something more powerful than any of us can
imagine lurking out there, just waiting for the right moment to reveal
itself.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> My name is Jeremiah. I have Abe's Oddysee and Munch's Oddysee. I
was just wanting to ask a few questions:

1. Who is Squeek?

2. Whenever i'm controlling Mucnh and greet a Mudokon they just laugh
at me. Why?

3. When Munch's Oddysee was originaly planned for PS2 was there a new
story line. And if so what was it?

Thanks for your time, Jerry

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> 1. A squeek is a short shrill cry or sound, such as that made
by a mouse or rusty hinge, or a mudokon attempting to maintain composure
while answering the most annoying questions on all of Oddworld ...

2\. Because you're funny lookin'.

3\. The story stays the same but not all of was included. There were
parts of Munch that will remain a mystery ... at least for now.

<p><b>Question:</b> I know the Glukkons manufacture a lot of products, but who buys
them, because other Glukkons don't seem like the buying type. Just
wondering, Stranger.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hey there, Stranger. Do you ever find yourself wondering,
"who am I?". Heh heh heh! Oh I crack me up.

Anyway, yeah, you're right. Glukkons are not only stingy, but they know
all the nasty stuff in the products they make. That's why they count on
the other creatures of Oddworld, coupled with mind-bending propaganda to
earn their profits.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, its me once again. In Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee, their
are those Blitzpacker drinks, but in Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus, there's
Soul Storm Brew. I know they are both bad and probably the same to you,
but whats the difference? Are they 2 different, competing brands, a
new-and-improved version, or what? Anyways, thanks for answering this,
and happy holidays. SLIGcatcher

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hi SLIGcatcher. Blitzpacker is a beverage power up for
possessed sligs, while SoulStorm Brew is the Glukkon's drink of choice
for addicting and controlling the Mudokon race. See the difference?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Which mud are you? Are you the one that pushes Abe into the
big-well?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Let's be clear about that so-called "pushing" scenario. I
merely gave my buddy Abe a gentle, encouraging pat on the back, like any
good friend would. Abe, being clumsy and of course subconsciously
wanting to go into the big well, FELL at the same time as the gentle
pat. OK? Got it? Or do I need to be a good friend to you, too? Huh? Well
do I?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hay Alf! I just wanted to know some stuff about the Glukkon Queen
and why Abe doesn't attack her.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hay-ay! Alfie in the Hay-ouse! Whudup? Hey, here's an idea:
Why don't you just go and attack the ruthless and oppressive leader of
another race? It's not easy, there is planning, tactical training, and
brew induced confidence that has to be achieved prior to such attacks!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf my favorite mud, Hows it going man any new female muds
you got your eye on? Well enough of the formal talk I was wondering who
wrote all the poetry that Abe says in his games? Was it Bigface or
Raisin perhaps anyway whoever wrote it maybe OWI can publish all the
poetry and stuff in a book and maybe even some fan poetry like the stuff
found on the site....that might be a good idea for merchandizing eh
taking some money out from the glukkons greedy paws or wait umm whatever
they hold their money with.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Have you ever seen a female mud? Bluckhhhaaaaaaa! They aren't
as attractive as you may think! Anyway, Abe isn't reciting poetry in the
games, he is narrating, speaking from his heart! He is the one who spoke
the poems that you heard. (I don't even know if he can write, but if he
can, I'll ask him to make a book of them!)
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hey alf! your my fav mud. i have a simple question, what are the
dominant species on oddworld, i always like to think it were the
glukkons who i have the honour to serve ... but i guess they are not,
maybe you know? terry the slig

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, it depends on the point in history that we are talking
about. I believe it is the waxing and waning of the moons that causes
the rise and fall of these cultures; it causes the tide, it makes the
weirdos come out, and no one else seems to have a better explanation.
And with multiple moons, well, things get pretty crazy around here!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Alf, yer just the greatest :) First of all, that book you are
holding in you're hand on the photo of you ...yes, that's right,the one
just over, yup thats it. Can I see it? Let me take a different approch.
Can you guy's at OWI write a few books for puplishing? I would looove to
sit down with a nice fairy tale about Oddworld. Not that I have anything
against Fan Fiction, but it's just not the same thing. It's not as
"real" (ahem). So, Alfie, when you got some spare time, could you either
write a novel or two or lend me that book you're reading. Secondly, I
would like a quick question. How come Abe has a tatoo on his chest in
the cinematics and not in the game? (That would be Abe's Exoddus, not
Munch's Oddysee).

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> First of all, I know I am, now get over it! Abe's tattoo?
What're your eyes stitched up or something? The tat is there. Maybe it's
just so dark in the mines that you can't see it.

As for a book ... Sure, I'll write a book. Let's see ... I can pencil

<p><b>Question:</b> Hi, I was just at oddworld.com and it said to send an email here
if you had a question about the website. I was just wondering how come
there aren't any Christmas pictures this year? I've been looking around
and I can't see any... The past few years there have been some really
good ones and I was looking forward to seeing more this year. OK that's
my question. I'm sorry if I wasn't supposed to send it here, I didn't
mean to waste your time. Thanks Kram (from Australia)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Kram, you are all wasting my valuable tea drinking time, but I
am loving and benevolent, so I carry on. You're welcome. We wanted to
post the Christmas pictures, but frankly they were all too inappropriate
to be posted. You know that people watch the internet all the time,
right now in fact. That is all I can say. I've already said too much.
Out.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, in Exoddus how can you tell which mud you are in the
desert scene? One more thing can Munch, Abe and his fellow mud's survive
really high falls, because in Munch's Odysee Abe can chuck his fellow
Mud's and Munch from really high platforms or buildings without them
getting hurt, and speaking of Abe chucking his fellow mud's can the
mud's jump for themselves or does Abe need to pick them up and throw
them?Thanks Alf, I'm a fan of you and the Oddworld Universe.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I am the severely dehydrated one. When not dehydrated, Mudokons
have amazing rubber-like qualities that prevent them from injury. And
yes, we can jump for ourselves, but muds are like little children. When
you are in a hurry, sometimes it's just easier and faster to DO IT FOR
THEM!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf, seeing as Munch's Oddysee is exclusive to XBOX, Why can"t
GW make a shorter cheaper game exclusive to PS2?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> So you are requesting a shorter, cheaper "Munch-Lite"? Let me
explain something to you: short and cheap, BAD. Full length and quality,
GOOD.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf, it's me again. Could you PLEASE tell me how the
industrial facilities are built and who builds them? Does it take a long
time, because those factories are HUGE! Thanks, Phlibbo

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Slave labor, mostly. The more slaves you have, the less time
it takes. The industrialists love to waste materials too, thus they
"super size" there facilities. The more trees they can cut and the more
rivers they can pollute, the bigger they feel.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I know Glukkons and Vykkers produce their...products...to make
moolah. To make moolah you have to have customers. It doesn't seem like
the Mudokons would be their only source of income. Who are the other
customers? Or am i just utterly wrong, and the Mudokons support the bad
guys bank accounts?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I suppose YOU'VE never bought anything that supported anyone
but good doers! See if you can make clear consumer decisions while your
mind is reeling from the case of brew you just drank! We didn't always
know what was in those products! We thought if it tasted good, it must
be good! That's what the commercials all said. I want my mommy!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How come the blind mudokon on Abe's Exoddus(where you drank all
that brew)fell down a hole, was there 301 Muds and if you can't answer
this, ask Abe or Lorne L.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Lorne says I don't have to answer any more if I don't want to.
He says I can have tea and a biscuit and take a nap.

'Till next time, this is the number one Mud that ain't no dud -- so when
you have a question and need the direct line to information central,
don't forget to ask Dear Alf!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Kurdt, I love you too, man! You have never heard of Magog
before? Really, you kids are getting cheated on your education, you
really should register a complaint! But really, Magog Cartel is serious
business. This name is many centuries old, and as I'm sure you know,
history that sticks around that long is likely to take part in the
future at some point. Just be careful how much digging you do, this
council of powerful financiers have a way of making problems disappear,
so don't be a problem, if ya know what I mean!

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, I was just wondering in Munch's Oddysee there is a huge
skeleton bone in the Paramite Run stage, I was just wondering if you
could clear that one up... There is no creature in Oddworld that big
that I have seen yet... Is that Searex I have heard a little about ..and
one more question please...if Oddworlds' next game isnt going to be
Munch's Exoddus then what the next installments purpose to the
Quintology? Thanx for the chat. Catch some tea some time else. -
Daniel

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You are correct. It is a creature that you have not seen yet.
And the purpose of the next installment in the Quintology is the same as
the others. The whole thing isn't about Munch, it never was! Abe would
be really hurt if he heard you say that!
</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> What kind of life exist on other continents of Oddworld other
than Mudos? Now I know thats a pretty deep question but have you seen
other continents of Oddworld other than Mudos?From a loyal fan and
hopefully one day a future conceptual artist Paramiteabe ...("-")

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Dear PA. I am content with the confines of Mudos and my cozy
Rehab for now. I know there is more out there, but, well, most of us are
pretty lazy and not really interested too much in anything beyond our
own backyards right now. If I hear anything, I'll let ya know!

<p><b>Question:</b> I'm getting Munch's Oddysee for my birthday and I can't wait. Any
ways, I would like to know if there is a Slog queen and will we see
slogs with machinery like robotic arms in future games thanx for your
time

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Wow, Happy Birthday! Slog Queen? I don't know. I guess slogs
have to come from somewhere, though I always thought they probably just
evolved from a stank-nasty cesspool. If the Glukkons or the Vykkers
found a good use for Slogs with robotic arms, I am sure that they would
build them. I'm not gonna be the one to bring it up, though.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I have a question to ask you about the glukkons. Here's the
question. W hat would happen if Mullock came back? Hope you answer my
question. May Odd be with you!Cody

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I have an answer for your question. Here is the answer: If
Molluck came back, everyone would know, as his stench precedes him!
Besides, Abey wouldn't let that happen, not in a bazillion years!!!!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey, Alf, how come you haven't recognized as a hero like that
bigshot Abe? And what exactly does BigFace have to hide? A facelift gone
wrong maybe? See ya, Robman.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, lets see. Abe saved the entire Mudokon race and
destroyed a majority of the corporations taking advantage of Mudos. I
make tea. You do the math! And let me tell ya something about BigFace:
he's got a big face! And a big heart! So don't you go talkin' 'bout Mr.
Big that way! He's gotta wear that mask because he's so beautiful you
couldn't bear to look straight at him! Your eyes would shrivel up like
used spooce!

<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf, I have a question. I read that Sam (the Mudokon Queen) is
the mother of all Mudokons. So, who is the father? -VaniLLaKiLLah

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, uh, Sam isn't exactly a one Mudokon kinda gal, if you

a they, and they are DRONES. Creepy, huh?

<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf! I wanna ask u what is ur Rehab tea made of? Thx Shen

<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, there are several recipes, but they all have one
ingredient in common: Alf's tender luvin' care!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Yo Alf, I have a few questions for you. First of all, what the
hell is that thing on a slig's face? I figure you would know the anatomy
of a slig from your years of the beating them silly. I thought it would
control their pants, based on the wires leading to them, but crawling
sligs have them too. My next question is probably a FAQ, but I'm too
lazy to check. But why are Abe's lips stitched together? Was it a sick
plan the gluks thought up to keep him from communicating? If that's the
case, it doesn't work too well. And the last one is, why did you get the
rehab and tea center? Why not Abe? He may be a goofy schmuck, but he's
the savior. Not that I think you're undeserving. So don't hurt me.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yo, lazy, I was gonna answer your question until you started
insulting my abilities as the Rehab and Tea Proprietor. Abe may be some
kinda savior, but he's no genius, and his entrepreneurial capabilities
are, what some might call "lacking". Besides, if he were tied up in the
Rehab, who would save the species? You? Pssssh!

<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf at the risk of repeating myself, I am in desperate need
of another fix of that amazing creation called ODDWORLD. Is there
anybody out there that can help? I have tried the doctors but he told me
he didn't have anything strong enough. I don't know what I can do. I

there anyone who knows where/ when/ how? Kind regards your most

<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Dear Shane, I have heard of people with your desperate

that beams constant Oddworld content over a special frequency can be
implanted in your noggin. Otherwise, have a sip of tea and quit yer

<p><b>Question:</b> I was wondering what Sam the Mudokon queen looks like. If she is
the mother of all the muds will that make her huge like a termite queen
or is she the same size as the rest of her family. Please sent a picture
or describe how she looks. Thanx bud.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yes, she is one huge motha! She's never had her picture taken;
our current megapixel technology just isn't mega enough.

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Just have a few questions for you... while I was reading "Dear
Alf" I saw that one of your answers was; "Have you ever seen a female
mud? Bluckhhhaaaaaaaa! They aren't as attractive as you think!" My
friends and I have been wondering for a while what do female muds look
like?

</p>
<hr>

<p><b>Question:</b> How come in Abe's games he doesn't need spooce to take control of
someone but in Munch's game you do?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Transmedial spoodiosis, coupled with the realtime continuum.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> In Munch's Oddysee, glukkons say "how am I gonna pay the rent?"
If they have no arms, how do they ever pay the rent anyway?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> This is going no where...

...Plus, why would they pay the rent if they are the leaders? That's
like the president paying the rent. : )

...and how does Lulu afford to put lulu funds everywhere if in the
beginning he has no money?

... and why is Abe a different color than everyone else?

...and is the Glockstar a pimp, cause my sister and I think so.

Please send your reply to my email address instead of Alf's rehab and
tea

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey, how do you reply to our emails? I may be wrong, but I'm
pretty sure Mudokons don't have computers. Does the Almighty Raison do
it for you? Somehow? He is Almighty after all.

<p><b>Question:</b> HI! My name is Stephen F. from Sussex in England. I Love ODDWORLD
so much I even bought a XBOX so I could get ODDWORLD:MUNCH's ODDYSEE and
I do most of my class work on it. (If I get the chance.) I also draw
comics of it! Any way I have a plan that will boost your success! Have
you thought of using famous actors? Well here's some suggestions: (these
actors come from the U.K.) Richard Br yers, David Jason, Robert Lindsy,
John Cleese, Dawn French and Rowan Atkinson. Bye Alf!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hi Stephen! I am glad that you are such a big fan! I can't
really agree, because I would probably be banished from Mudos forever if
I didn't say that our creator Lorne Lanning's character voices are
superior to all others. Although, one of the actors you mentioned seems
just perfect for a particular role.

<p><b>Question:</b> Hey alf, thanx for putting my last question on your website I
appreciate the thought, so to thank you I have some questions about your
precious tea and rehab place and they are: Do you use spooce as one of
the secret ingredients for your tea or do they taste soooo bad that
spooce don't get your sign of approval? and besides tea will you put up
a juice & rehab to go with your tea and rehab?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Anonymous: Spooce tea would probably taste like mud and money
pie. Do you know how many people have touched a dollar bill by the time
you get it! Ack! Can someone please bring me my sanitizer!?!!! The mere
thought of it gives me an infection. As for juice, I can't be bothered
with all that squeezing. Do you know how hard it is to squeeze a piece
of fruit with a mug in one hand and the other on the keyboard? I'd have
to employ something with more arms, then there's that mess with social
security, workmuds comp.... Headaches I tell you! Headaches!

<p><b>Question:</b> Hello Alf! I'm a little new at this but I hope it wouldn't hurt if
I ask a few questions. thanks!  Gerald

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well Gerald, I don't normally do this, but it is a slow month
and I shall be answering ALL of your questions!

1. What made all you native people and the industrial punks hate each
other in the first place? (Was it a BIG disagreement between the mudokon
queen and the glukkon queen?)

A: Excellent question! It wasn't always like this. There used to be
balance on Oddworld. But overpopulation caused fights over land, mates,
resources, etc... and a great divide between the species. At first there
was just fighting, fighting everywhere, but then even the dumbest of
species realized how futile that was and slowly the militaristic clans
became special interest groups, utilizing business as a vehicle for
their goals. It's no big surprise that those with the most war-like
tendencies were the best at business. That's how the riff between the
tree huggers and the land muggers all got started.

2. I noticed in Abe's Oddysee and Abe's Exoddus Abe's voice changed.
What happened?

A: Puberty.

3. I looked and saw one guy asked about an oddworld movie. If you are
making an oddworld movie what will it be called?

A: Um, I think we have to figure out the movie part before we name
it.

4. Finally, I read that the industrial punks want to find Molluck
allive just to shoot him. What did Molluck do to make the other guys
want to shoot him after the lighting bolt went to his head?

A: Molluck didn't get where he was by making friends and influencing
people. He lied, cheated, back stabbed and stepped on whoever necessary
to get what he wanted. He used fear-based management techniques. Now,
what do you think? : )
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf my boy, It's me STEPHEN again! Pardon me boy, but could
you answer these questions?

1.Why does ABE's voice change in ABE's EXODDUS? Did his voice break?

2.I have seen a black and white picture of a KINTO SLAVE but, what
colour is it?

3.Do Irwin and Humphrey LOVE each other?(I really hope not!)or are
they best mates?

4.WHAT THE HECK IS A SEA REX??????????????????????? Bye! Stephen

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Bonjour Stephen! Wow, lots of people interested in the voice
thing. Next!

Kintos are a lovely shade of Burnt Sienna. Or maybe it is Raw Sienna.
Can I get an artist in here? PDD! Here PDD! (whistle) Come here boys! Oh
never mind. They're brown.

Irwin and Humphrey? Of course they love each other... they are best
mates ; )

A Sea Rex is a mysterious and elusive creature that, out of respect, I
shall no longer speak of. The more who know about it the less likely the
species is to survive. Au Revoir!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, I wanna know why Abe has a red and black hairdo. You can
see it real clearly on the Abes Oddysee front cover for PSX. See ya,
Robman P.S. Don't say he just did the haircut because I know that ain't
true.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Duh! Red and black are the hottest of haute couture!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, are sligs from the wild or are they made by Glukkons?
Please reply

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sligs are not made by Glukkons. They are born in captivity
and leased at birth as corporate security personnel. Only their “gear”
is manufactured. They are given mechanical pants or wings, batons, tear
gas, various types of weaponry, but are never taught to use any of them
all that effectively. They are easily impressed and even misled by
anyone who sports larger or more exotic weaponry than their own. Status
is very important to Sligs.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> "Hey there fellow chump!" "How's it hangin'" Recognize any of these
phrases from "Munch's Oddysee"?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No. Not at all. ; )
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Well I finally have an Xbox and I'm playing the game like it's my
child. I'll start by reasking a question I have previously asked. When
Oddworld Inhabitants finish with the Oddworld Quintology, will they move
on to some multiplayer Oddworld games like racing games, fighting games
or even party games?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I think when Oddworld finishes the Quintology, a new one will
be started. Or maybe a Heptology or a Quadrology ... ooooh, maybe a
decology! Possibly an Alfology!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Now I'll ask two new questions.Kind regards your most desperate
fan Shane.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Must you? I'm getting weak!

Are sligs evil because Glukkons force them to be? And that somewhere
on Oddworld there are some nice ones?

</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Can you give us any info on you said you will make when you have
the money?

structure of because bad and words missing probably.

Director Phleg?

</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf Buddy, What are the differences between Scrabs and Alpha
Scrabs and why can't you do the shred attack in Munch's Oddness? That's
all for now. Thanks Alf.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Alpha Scrabs are the leader of the pack. They are usually the
dominate Scrab. In Munch's Oddysee, the Scrabs had vast areas of
wilderness to roam to let their aggressions out. In Abe's Exoddus the
Scrabs resided in the Mudanchee Vaults and rarely see the outdoors.
Think about it, if you never got to go play outside you'd shred attack
someone too!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf! Oddguy from OWF here with a question \drumroll\ Can you
give out a name for at least one of the new species appearing in Steef?
I'm just so curious! Thank you kind sir!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Such a polite chap, that Oddguy is. Well, I suppose I could
clear up a small bit of confusion, how would that be? One of the species
is in fact STEEF! Yes, it is true. Steef is not a character name but the
name of a species; similar to how Mudokon and Gabbit are also species.
Isn't it amazing! ! ! !
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf ... I know I know I'm asking two questions in the same
month but I think this one is important ... I was at my local Gamestop
store and I was looking at the Coming Soon sign hanging from the ceiling
and as I was reading all the new games that were coming out ... there it
was ... it said Oddworld Munch's Oddysee 2 and it's release would be in
October. I was shocked and I felt I had to ask the expert ... is this
true?! ?!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Heya Mike, I gotta tell ya, I'm not sure what it means! Likely
that crazy sign is referring to the GameBoy Advance version of Oddworld:
Munch's Oddysee now in stores everywhere. With all the uncertainty in
the world right now, there is one thing I can say for sure: The next
game isn't coming out in October! Wouldn't that be great? But sorry, is
no come out yet.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, 1. Do the Oddworld Inhabitants arrange visits/tours for
fans?
2. When are we going to get some information about the stranger (Steef
is a cool name)?
3. Are Elum going to be in the next game?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Dear
Expletive-for-a-first-name-that-I-had-to-partially-star-out -Tom,  
1. Once in a while, under " exceptional" circumstances, fans are allowed
to visit the studio. It is really rare these days, though, because we
have that whole "development of a video game" thing going on.
Priorities, you know. We need every able-bodied programmer programming,
designer designing, modeler modeling ... well, you get the idea.  
2. Official news (thanks for the compliment about the name Steef, I'm
glad you like it! ) about the stranger? Well if we told you all about
him he wouldn't exactly be a stranger, now would he? So uh, not gonna
happen.  
3. If Elum is in the next game, I doubt he will be holding the same
position as last time.

<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, Has the Raisin always lived "underground" and is he
afflicted with the same gaseous curse as Abe and Munch?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No! How do you think he got all wrinkled and raisiny? That
takes sunshine fool! Ok, sorry. Prophet and retired spiritual advisor,
the raisin has lived several lives in various lands. The elderling once
advised the tribal chiefs of many diverse cultures. But those are days
long past. With the Vykkers around, he's got to stay in hiding with his
Ratz. As for his personal odor issues, it's not certain. No one dares
walk all the way around to his backside. (It would be sacrilegious! ) He
does let out a mean snore, though!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Yo Alf, I noticed that the Vykker's have really bad teeth. What
happened? You'd think that they'd have really good dental insurance,
being scientists an all. So what's up with their messed up drills?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yeah, man, I dunno. I guess they've been sampling the sweets
that they would normally test. Or maybe it's just bad genes. Like most
Doctors and Scientists they don't necessarily practice what they preach.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Alfster, Where can I get me some o them fancy schmancy Speedo's
like those fashionable interns wear? I heard that they are to die for
... all five of the Fab Five have a pair!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> A: Those gut huggers are custom made for the interns. Not for
sale to the general public. Besides, I have a feeling that putting on a
pair of those would be tantamount to, well, something really
uncomfortable!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, I heard the line to the rehab is real long. I was thinking
about joining, but I'd like to get an idea of the wait time. Exactly how
long is it? And none of that metric mumbo jumbo, either!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, my friend, I can't see the end of it from my chaise
lounge, so it still must be pretty darn long. I suppose if I got up and
addressed the issue, it might help, but I haven't even dressed myself
yet today, let alone any issues! See ya at the end of the line, sucker!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Alf, I have a pet slog who has been such a dear, tearing up the
neighbors and leaving Slog Dumplins in their yards. What is the
appropriate treat for my sweetums?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, it's like the old rhyme from my childhood goes:  
Lick wack, Mudokon smak  
Give your slog a bone!  
This old mud came limpin' home!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, I noticed in a copy of the Daily Deception one of the
headlines reads, "Rupture Farms Grand Re-Opening Delayed! " So what's
the scoop? When will Rupture Farms re-open?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> According to Munch's Oddysee for the GameBoy Advance now
available on store shelves everywhere; the land where RuptureFarms once
stood was rebuilt into "Evenwurst Weiner Factory".

<p><b>Question:</b> Q:  Hiya Alf! I've been wondering just who came up with the idea of
the game's setting as a meat packing plant. I myself looove the looks of
refineries and big factories how they have so many pipes and big somke
stacks and there's lights everywhere and there's huge machinery. A lot
of people don't except the person who made the setting of the game. So
what I'm saying is who came up with the idea of putting a meat packing
plant as a setting and why? Your BIGGEST fan, Mike.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well there, Big Mike, I'm happy to hear that you think the
structure which enslaved and later snackified my brothers is so visually
appealing!!!! Who could think up such a demented and horrible place?
Lorne Lanning, that's who. Luckily he also thought it would be cool to
have a saviour to lead us out of that Odd forsaken bung hole.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> dear alf, everyone else e-mails in to see pics of muds, about
technology and that sort of stuff...but we on the other hand...have seen
real mudokons...and are on a quest to save them...though it is VERY
DIFFICULT...especially when 1 in 10 will not pay the slightest attention
to us...being a mudokon yourself (elssacecon bow to you) could you tell
us how to approach these shy and very fast mudokons... - THANX-
ElSsAceCon xxx

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> EISsAceCon, All you need is bait. Try offering those chumps
some tea or brew and munchies!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Amazing Alf, I was wondering...What ever happened to the
flethches or what ever they were called? Will there be an "Oddworld:
Munch's Exodus"? How come in Abe's Oddysee the Scrab's attacked each
other and they don't in Munch's Oddysee? Will we ever see a female
character? Will there ever ba a "Slig Army"? Thank's for your time
...("-")

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Since most fleeches get flushed when they become too obnoxious
for their owners to handle, you can find most of them hanging out in the
marshes, lakes, sewers and forests of Oddworld. I don't recommend going
and looking for them, though. You know what they say, two heads are
better than one! especially for chomping an innocent bystander!

Oddworld Munch's Exoddus? Read the FAQs. I'm sure that in time some of
the female characters of Mudos will be revealed.

A slig army? I doubt it. They are highly social and easily misled by
those with larger weapons than their own. Can you imagine the chaos just
of setting up the chain of command? Madness!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, I have a few more questions if you don't mind. If all of
your eggs are shipped to factories how come there are so many wild
Mudokens? Also are you a wild Mudoken or did Abe save you? Also if its
not asking too much could you have Abe open a bird portal to Earth? My
bags are even packed already! From Oddball\_zim

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Dear OBZ, Well, there were Mudokons around before the eggs
were shipped, so you do the biological math!

I myself am a worker class like Abe.

I will see about the bird portal thing. Maybe we could switch houses for
a week or two. You can run the rehab while I lounge in your cabana just
off the keys. You do have a cabana just off the keys, don't you?????
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Alf, if Abe and his fellow Muds can survive really high falls
than how come in Abes oddysee and exoduss you cant survive them, you
just die.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, if you drop a super ball from an airplane, it ain't
gonna bounce back to you. Everyone and everything has its limits.
Mudokons are no exception.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf my favourite mud, I wanna know why the sligs and glukkons
don't get afraid when Abe starts chanting to posses them in Munches
oddysee. One more thing how come in Munches when you posses a glukkon
you cant kill him by self disrupting him. Thanks for your time Alf
buddie. 

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, actually, by possessing a Glukkon, you ARE
“self-disrupting' him. If you want to kill him, or make him
self-destruct, that is another story. Personally, I think it is more
entertaining to play with their minds.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf Why are Glukkons profit crazy and evil? Were they born
bad? Christopher

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It's part genetics, part environmental. A little bit country,
a little bit rock and roll.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf! I got a few questions for ya. What happened between Abe's
Exoddus and Munch's Oddysee? How much time was there in between them? A
few days? Weeks? How did Abe come across the Almighty Raisin? Do Big
Face and the Almighty Raisin know each other? Did they meet before
Munch's Oddysee? Will Big Face return in the next Oddworld game? Okay,
so its more than a few questions but only one more question. In the
opening movie for Abe's Exoddus where you and Abe first get into Necrum
Mines, did the Mudokon push Abe off or did he fall? If the mudokon did
push him, were you that mud? Thanks Alf!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Between AE and MO? Well, let's see, there was the big one,
then my downward spiral into black tea drinking, the goat tee phase, my
cubist period, my blue period, my lack of punctuation period (spawned by
the internet), and then the inevitable feta and avocado on flatbread
period. Odd how I love flatbread. It is like bread, only satisfyingly
flat! Ok, so that was probably more information than you wanted, but
just one more useless tidbit: I may or may not have pushed Abe. Those
memories are foggy, very foggy!!!..
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, I think all of the Oddworld games have been great so
far. Naturally, I have some questions.(It would be pretty pointless not
having any)

1. Are you going to be making an online/multiplayer game somewhere in
the future?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hmmm!. Good idea!

2. Why don't mudokons steal sligs guns after they've been killed?

</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> "hey ALf! I was wonderin' if you could give us fans any info about
the kinto slaves, octigi, gloktigi, meetle and mug? Also could you by
any chance talk to the webmaster about starting a page for ideas for the
games that were never used in the final version. Thanks, Kendall

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hi Kendall, I can't tell you much about them now, but pretty
soon you might be learning more. I tried to talk to the webmaster about
games, but that chump is always at the massage chair or the coffee shop!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi, long time no sneeze... See! Ehm, I was wondering what the
reahab is like late at night when the young muds go home to sleep. Do
you serve brew? (Yes, I know that's the whole point of the tea, to heal
muds from brew...) becuas in that case, you could sell them tea
afterwords... I think you almost must do this Alfie, sense all mudokons
know brew is bad, AND Soulstorm is blown to pieces... So therefor you
must have yer own secret brewery, to keep the customers in, to buy tea.
Otherwise I have some aditional questions.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You are the man that invented the deodorant that makes you
sweat, the breath mint that makes breath smell bad, the acne gel that
makes you break out, the diet soda that makes you fat! You are an evil,
evil man! But I respect your ingenuity and will answer your questions
accordingly.

1: Why did Mullock start the Employe of the year thing? They are
slaves after all. You know what I think? I think Mullok had a bigger
heart than you think :p

</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf i have two questions iv been dieing to ask you 1 is: on
Abes Exoddus why didnt you listen 2 abe when he told you not to dring
the brew when you knew what a hero he was and that he had saved 99
modokons from rupture farms. And another is: why do scrabs and paramites
and other creatures attack abe on sight, do they have a natural instinct
to kill mudokons or something ur greatest rehab attendent KIT

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Uh, we all drank the brew, even Abe, until he saved us and I
started the Rehab. Get it straight! If you are a rehab attendant I
oughta have you scrubbing latrines! Scrabs and paramites attack because
they are hungry, like most wild animals they have to eat, and if the
food wants to play chase, even better!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is this Alf im not sure. Well i got ?'s. When does the Shrink
appear and will Vykkers be in the next odd game? Also... how come you
scare me? j/w. buh-by

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It's me, unfortunately. Just to try and salvage some tiny,
itsy bitsy smaller-than-human-hair fragment of my reputation, I will
tell you that it is highly likely that the Vykkers will play a role in
the next game. Not for sure, but probably.

Why do I scare you? Are you also afraid of other tea makers? Do you have
issues with Rehab? Why do people come to me with their personal
problems? I don't have time to deal with this slogwash.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, I have four very good questions for you to answer.
Please respond back to them:)

1. At the end of Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus, was Abe at your Alf's Rehab
and Tea party?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oh yeah, me and Abe party together all the time.

2. What made you join Abe in his journey to SoulStorm Mining Co.?

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: When can I expect to see the PC version of Munch’s Oddysee in the
stores?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> We are currently concentrating on the Xbox version. It is yet
to be determined if there will be a PC version.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will we be able to revisit some of the places Abe has been in
Munch’s Oddysee? Are all those screens of the forest area Paramonia?
Plus, can we go see the ruins of some of the factories Abe blew up??

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> A return to the ruins of Rupture Farms figures in Munch’s
Oddysee.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I heard that in Munch’s Oddysee that Abe and Munch can travel
together or seperately. What happens to Munch if Abe has to go on a solo
mission? Does he just sit there, or start acting on his own??

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Munch is a very young creature, only recently reintroduced to
the world after long confinement inside Vykkers Labs. Leave him alone
and he has a tendency to hunker down and wait for someone to come get
him.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Whatever happened to SligStorm? I’d heard it was going to star an
albino Slig larva, and run on the Abe’s Exoddus engine. I know it’s been
scrapped, but why? Can you tell s’more details about it?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> SligStorm was briefly considered as a Playstation game, but
publishing plans are always in flux, and we elected not to pursue that
particular project. The SligStorm concept remains on our drawing boards
and may see the light of day … and sooner than you expect.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will there be a temple for Scrabs or Paramites or something like
that?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Not in Munch’s Oddysee, no. But there will be plenty of new
native structures that you’ve never seen before.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is the sound team planning on putting some
more-appeasing-to-the-teens kind of songs, or are you guys going to
stick to the classic majestic feeling of Abe’s Oddysee and Exoddus?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oddworld’s musical style is a signature element of the series,
and I don’t anticipate it will change any time soon.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why is Abe blue?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> He’s depressed.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> In Abe’s Exoddus, who is the guy that is locked all alone in the
brewery that gives Abe the power to heal the three he frees from the
tear extractor?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There are helper Mudokons scattered all through the Abe
adventures. They’re friends of BigFace.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> The Oddworld Universe has amazing images. Who does the art, who
draws and paints these masterpieces? Also, I’ve noticed that in many
pictures a Mudokon is holding a spear. Was this an early addition to the
game, or just an artist’s conception?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oddworld has a staff of very talented Production Designers
responsible for creating the Oddworld Universe the old fashion way
(pencils, paints & paper)! The Mudokon-with-spear was early conceptual
art, and never appeared in a game.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I read that the planet of Oddworld is ten times as big as Earth and
that all the action has taken place in the region of Mudos. Will other
regions be revealed in Munch’s Oddysee?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The action of Munch’s Oddysee remains in Mudos … but you
haven’t yet seen even a fraction of Mudos, let alone other areas of the
world that will appear in future Quintology titles.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was wondering on Oddworld if there are casinos, clubs, and
amusement parks? I also want to know what type of religion does each
species have? Also, you are sooo cute Alf!!!!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The Glukkons love casinos, clubs, and amusement parks, and we
have tentative plans to feature such venues in Munch’s Exoddus. As far
as religion goes … well, Glukkons worship Moolah, while Mudokons keep
their religious feelings to themselves.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> In Abe’s Exoddus(PC), the credits have a movie-like picture with
mudokons all wired up to these “devices” by their feet. Is this a movie
that I missed, or is it a cut-scene from Munch’s Oddysee?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Not sure, but it sure sounds like you missed the Bad Ending
where Abe gets his butt fried!

more thing do you know what the next oddwold game be called and when is
it comeing out? your odd friend —Grant

their wallets! And I know nothing of the next Oddworld game, except that
there is one.
</p>

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I haven't played Munch's Oddysee - I haven't got an XBox - but I
have read what I can about it. I've noticed in one review that at one
point you get chased by a herd of scrabs. A herd of scrabs?! Shouldn't a
herd of scrabs rapidly become a smaller herd of full scrabs and then
down to one exceedingly fat scrabs? Mind you, there must be some way
that they can interact peacefully in order to procreate. I'm really
curious to find out more. Please enlighten me. ...("-")

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well the procreation doesn’t have to be peaceful. Of course in
our fairy tale minds we want it to be but it isn’t always so. As you may
know creatures often act completely different in large groups. The
larger the group, the stranger things get. Hey, wait a minute, why
haven’t you played Munch’s Oddysee? I don’t have time for this drivel!
Poof! Be gone!

answer--if its not to much trouble for ya! Enjoy!  
Signed, oDdAnT

1.What kind of Natural Resources are there down in OddWorld?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> We’ve got fossil fuels, water, dirt, plants and spooce. All
kinds of great stuff that you could live off of for centuries. Barring
any money-mongering industrialists, that is.

2.How come just about every industrail character works for the
Glukkons?

</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> O.k., so that's more than a few questions \~sorry\~ but please
respond back to them! ttyl! bye!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Don't be sorry, be odd... and STAY ODD!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, My question is while I was browsing the Oddworld site i
stumbled upon a picture that said Fud TV. What is Fud TV? And, unless it
appeared in an earlier game and I missed it, will it appear in the next
game? One of your biggest fans, Mike

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Mike, FUD TV is the station that unearthed The Bones-Brew
Connection and attempted to make it public knowledge. The circumstances
surrounding their success and their whereabouts remain in question.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> dear alf I know im just an ant in a world of things to you, but
as a fan i wonder so much about the next odd world game. and im sure you
get tons of e-mails about it, and magazines bothering you like crazy,
and what not. i just think tomyself... what could be cooking up for the
next game. i havent herd a single thing about it. does it invalve munch?
is it funny like munch's oddessy.... or kinda darker like odd abb's 2
tittles. well i cant wait to know. keep up the wonderful work. and let
the fans here to good word!! thank you. —John

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> John! You are not an ant! A slimy, light-fearing cockroach
maybe, but not an ant! As for the next game it is still in the oven. Did
you see the Discovery special? You really have to check it out, it’s all
the rage.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> To Whom it May Concern: I hope I sent this request to the right
address; I was wondering who was the voice actor for the Sligs in
Munch's Odyssee? I realize he acted for several characters in the game.
I traded Odyssee last year so I couldn't look up the credits, but I
still remember his work on the game and a few words came to mind:
entertaining, humorous, and talented! I hope he will be available to
make a contribution to your upcoming games for the Xbox. Thanks for your
time! Sincerely, Brian

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Brian, I really hope that he can contribute to the upcoming
games as well, because the voice talent for the Sligs was none other
than our very own Lorne Lanning, President and Creative Director of
Oddworld Inhabitants. He’s the brain behind ALL of this crazy stuff!
</p>

<p><b>Alf:</b> All I can say is it's probably going to get Stranger.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey,I was wondering why you aren't going to put Oddworld out on
Playstaion because the first two games are on Playstation? And when are
some of the Oddworld movies going to come out? And for my final
question, When you sign up with the fan club do they send you mail like
letters or do they send you E-mail. Oh YEAH!One more question, how
longdoes it take for the mail to come? thanks,Alf!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Munch’s Oddysee was an Xbox exclusive because the Xbox has
superior harware capabilities and is easier to program for. If you want
a more detailed explanation, you can look up the November 2000 archives
for a statement from our President and CEO.

I don’t know when the movies will come out. Could be a while, though.
Movies are a big process!

When you sign up for the fan club you will get an initial mail letting
you know the form you submitted worked, then I will send you mail very,
very sporadically. Hey—it’s a work in progress! As for mail, it is a
fickle system that often results in people accusing me of not sending
anything. Whatever!
</p>

do with writing. He’s a left brainer.

2. Will any of the Oddworld heroes actually meet the queens? I've seen
pictures of them, well apart from Skillya...

<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, I was wondering about Abe's Mom. At the end of Abe's
Exodus, it said that the next game would introduce her but you never see
her in Munch's Game? What gives?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> What gives? No one gives anymore. It’s just take, take, take!
Besides, why would ABE’s mom be in MUNCH’s game? That is what I would
like to know!

<p><b>Question:</b> Oddworld-Web: Abe hey this is abester i have 3 questins 1 will
abe be in further games 2 will elum be in further games3 howcome you and
abe like never have a pet like a scrab or paramite or fuzzles or are
elums and meetles your pet

<p><b>Alf:</b> 1. Maybe

2\. Maybe

3\. Pets = waste. Alf doesn’t do waste. Hey, you gotta draw the line
somewhere.

<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, While I was watching Gulliver's Travels and sitting
amoungst my piles of dirty clothing and moldy week old pizza, I realized
I was pretty darn hungry, and penicilin just wasn't gunna cut it. So
strangly enough I found myself ungluing myself from the TV and heading
toward the fridge. Nothing there appeared edible, well unless you like
glass jars or cinema hot dogs (stangly enough I hear people eat such
things.) Anyway, I thought to myself, "What would be better right now
than a Meech Munchie?" I went down to the store and I hear that they are
extint! So I asked them for a Paramite Pie, but they were all out. I
didn't know what else there was, so I just went home, but when I got
there the "Travels" were over. So my question comes in two parts: \#1
Can you give me a list of all those tasty, delectable treats (some
pictures whould be nice too) so I can properly decide what I can get at
the store, and so I don't miss my shows. and \#2 Is it healthy to leave
my TV alone for so long like that? I swear those 20 minutes were one of
the most horrifing moments in all my life. Sincerly,  
Chris "Hungry and Scared"

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Dear Chris, You are in luck my friend! You can visit the
Rupture Farms catalogue at www.Oddworld.com in the November 2002

<p><b>Question:</b> Does Phleg have acromegaly?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Ok, lets not kid ourselves. The real question is, "does Alf
have to look acromegaly up in the dictionary?" Well the answer is yes,
as a matter of fact I do, as that is a very obscure medical reference
that I personally have no interest in. The answer to the other, more
superfluous question is no. Phleg does not have acromegaly. He just has
a severe case of egostroke-e-osis. Oh yes. That, my fellow buds, is what
I call linquistics in action.

<p><b>Question:</b> Q:  Not to bother you again. I was curious... is this one person, or
a thing where a bunch of people use one name and answer the
overabundance of fans who have pointless questions. (Chuckles), sorry.
Um, thanks for your advice. So how did you get into this job? Oh, and
could you, er....will you send information on the new oddworld game? I
missed the sneek peek on the discovery channel. I love oddworld games.
They are so original and mindblowing. It would be cool to meet the
creator, and tell him how awesome he is, and that there are a lot of
kids in Troy, Illinois who love these games, and cannot wait for the
next installments. Anyhoo, any pics that you can send, and info would be
much appreciated! Thanks again! Love and light! —Randy

<p><b>Alf:</b> Randy, please my friend, bother away! It is merely I, the

<p><b>Question:</b> Greetings, Mr. Alf!! How odd are you?? Some days ago i read the
answers and questions of "Dear Alf" section and suddenly the inspiration
came to me!! You probably know what is to come, heheheh.

Would you mind answering the questions that are corroding my human
little brain????????????? ó.ò

Would you refuse to do it before these big "starving-Mudokon-like"
eyes???????????????????????? Ó.Ò

hehehehe Ok, before you say anything, the real question are:

(6) Why the native mudokons that appear in oddworld first games were
exactly equal to Abe and not full of feathers, paitings on their skin
and things like that??Were the natives of abe's oddysee and exoddus
actually the mudokons abe saved??????

Well, thanks for your attention, Mr. Alf. I promise you that when I
formulate new questions, you'll be the first one to know it,
heheheheheheheheheheh.

Have a nice day!!

"Love"

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hey there chuckles, Sorry about deleting your first five
questions, but at Alf's Rehab, Alf's the only one who gets to be
excessive. Them's the rules. So, \#6: Mudos is populated by a whole slew
of native Mudokons, all of different tribal background and heritage,
each with their own unique customs and manner of dress and uh, makeup.
The entire Mudokon race is indebted to Abe for his actions.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> is there going to be any new characters in the new game???
...("-")

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yup, new game = new characters. Woohoo!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, I was wondering who it is who does all that wacky
Oddworld art? Could it be just the "production designer" Farzad
Varahramyan (yes! I spelled it right!). Or is it the "game designers?" I
don't know, do you?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, you're a good speller, but your info is a little watered
down. Over the years Oddworld has employed many talented art-folk.

Right now we have a team of three production designers: Raymond
Swanland, Silvio Aebischer, and Gautam Babbar. They are all super
talented, each in their own right and are slaving away, pencil in hand,
right at this very moment to keep the art flowing.

Now, the Game Designers are equally as talented, but they do something
entirely different! They plan out the logistics of the game, make it fun
and functional, and although they may be closet artists, that's not the
talent we harvest from their bountiful minds. At least not yet.....
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf I have a couple of questions. 1. in the upcoming game do
you play as abe or is he out of the storie. 2. Also does the latest game
still have the same type of gameplay.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Uh, no, no, and sorta but not really.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Alf I have three Questions

1.Are you guys making a game called Hand On Odd which is a online
multi player game if so can you give me the date it comes out?

2.What would you give Munchies Oddseey for the X-Box.

3.I dont have an X-box is there a default in them.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hand on Odd. Heeheeeheee! No. There are rumors about Hand of
Odd, but we're not working on that right now.Your second question, quite
frankly, confuses me. I guess if you were talking about a score of 1
through 10, I would have to say a 7. After all, I'm not in it- how good
could it possibly be? And yeah, there are a lot of defaults in the Xbox,
but then, consumers have their defaults, too, right?

<p><b>Question:</b> I was just reading the article in gameinformer magazine about the
next oddworld coming out. And all I'm wondering is why? Is Abe going to
be in the game at all. He has been the star of the past three games,
well sharing the role with munch. Please give a more in-depth
explanation if at all possible. A concerned gamer —Erik

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Dear Erik the Concerned, Don't be concerned, dude. Abe is just
worn out and needs a rest. And aren't you just the least bit interested
in what other characters inhabit Mudos? I know I am. I mean, it's
foolish to think that Mudokons are the only species out there, right? We
can't be the only ones...........
</p>

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hello, Alf! I'm Eduardo, and I am Brazilian, so, if you can read
this, tell me, and I will send more questions. Will you guys release one
RPG game of Oddworld some day? I love RPGs, and it would be very good to
see Abe, Monch and all of those folks in one RPG game. Eduardo

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hello Eduardo! An Oddworld RPG? I wouldn't rule it out, but
we definitely aren't working on it at the moment. The focus right now is
on that Stranger you saw on the Discovery Channel.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> "Dear Alf, As much as I love Munch's Oddysee so far, I find myself
missing the old 2D gameplay of the first 2 games. Has the idea of making
a 3d oddworld game on a 2d track (a' la Contra: Shattered Soldier or
Duke Nukem Manhattan Project) been kicked around at all? I felt that the
main reason that I liked the first 2 Oddworld games were that they were
beautifully done 2d games in an era where the industry was moving into
3d, they kind of showed that 2d still has it's place in the industry.
And now with Oddworld and Castlevania as well going 3d I'm wondering if
2d is actually heading out to pasture for good. Thanks in advance for
taking the time to read this. Oh, and regardless of my preferences for
gameplay I just wanted to congratulate the folks over at Oddworld
Inhabitants for creating a world with so muchh beauty and depth. Thanks
again, Kenny

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well first of all, thank ya from all the Inhabitants! That is
a huge compliment. As much as we all love the first two 2D games, (you
aren't the first to point it out), the background of the founders of
Oddworld is steeped in 3D tradition. Sherry and Lorne both come from the
3D effects industry, and are always looking for new challenges and ways
of expressing the Oddworld story. So the goal is to eventually move into
4D and 5D, where in real time is actually REAL TIME, and you can
actually taste and smell everything, creating the first-ever, fully
functional immersive video game experience. Oh, and did I mention that I
don't play games? So I don't have a clue what I'm talking about. But
wouldn't that be sweet! Possibly even sour......
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, I'm thinking of getting Xbox Live and I was wondering
whether the next Oddworld Title will support it. If it's still undecided
or under-wraps, that's fine. Anyway, thanks for your time. SLIGcatcher

<p><b>Question:</b> Good tidings to you Alf old bean! now i have to admit i was a bit
slow off the mark getting Munches Oddysee....and i love it...but!....i
finished it in under a week!...dude whats goin on! the first 2 games i
was stuck on for weeks on end...but i love how theres more then 2 ways
to solve the puzzles...that fact i like muchly..gimme something to sink
my teeth into man!!! just 1 more question tho........Do the sligs have a
Workers Union? —Dom

<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Wow, I've never been referred to as a bean. I feel kind of,
well, pretty and cute, and sproutish. Unlike those dirty, rotten Sligs.
Union? Puhleaze. The closest sligs will ever get to anything resembling
a union is their relationship with their pants.

<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf, my name is Alex and i´m from germany. So, my english
isn´t the best! ;-) Question: How was the graphic in the three games
made? I mean, is it "2D-Pixel-Art" or 3D-Rendering? Or a combination?
Best wishes, Alexander.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, the first two games, Abe's Oddysee and Abe's Exoddus
were 2D side-scrolling platformers, and Munch Oddysee was a 3D
platformer.

</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf I have one question in the last level of Munch's Oddysee
when you had to fight all of those armored Sawbones with the Mudarchers
were those elums on the table with there head cut off or some new odd
creature that we havent seen yet please write back and thanks for your
time your odd little friend, Cody

<p><b>Alf:</b> Yeah, you'd think having a flatulent rider on your back all
day would be the worst, but sadly, most Elums endure a fate far less
enjoyable.

<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf, I'm a german Oddworld fan, and I Love Oddworld, so I have
some questins for you (don't lought my english was bad): "Are we meet
Abe or Munch in the next game?" (I'm sorry, when an other Asks it,
too...) "Are the next game on an other Continent of Oddworld?" "Are you
make an Oddworld Movie?" Thank you verry much by  
Oddys (13 jears)

<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oddys, Don't be ridiculous, your English is far better than
most Americans'! Honestly, I don't know for sure yet if Abe or Munch
will be in the next game. I do know that it will take place here in
Mudos, though. And yes, we hope to one day make an Oddworld movie. For
the love of ODD pleeeeeease make that movie soon, people! Oooops, did I
actually write that? I'm a little anxious, that's all.

<p><b>Question:</b> hi alf ElSsAceCon here thanx for replyin the munchies are helpin
us find the mudokon's ive got 3 questions once again about the real
mudokons:

1. if mudokons could choose to be any animal on earth what would you
be and why?

2. does big face ever tire of wearing that mask all day and does he
ever take it off?

3. final question: sligs are evil but when we were chased by one he
tripped are they ever clumsy on oddworld?

thanx alf, ElSsAceCon xxxx

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> EISlongobscurenamedontfeelliketypingitalldangit, If I could be
any animal on Earth it would be a Bulldog, where I could lounge at my
master's feet on a soft pillow of tartan plaid and sup the finest Earl
Grey from a gold-rimmed puppy bowl and be referred to as “such a good
lad”.

Regarding Big face: he wears the mask as religiously as the wife of a tv
evangelist, my dears.

On the clumsiness of sligs: you'd trip too if you had to learn to walk
(let alone run) in metal trousers!

<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Aunty Slig, oh, I mean Alf how ya' doin'? its me againy
Stephen French! mind if I might ask?.........

1.I now know that you will be doing Hand of Odd and Squeak's or should
I say? Steef's Oddysee, but what about Munch's Exoddus? cos' we need
another Exoddus man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:(

2.in the fourth game will Abe and his good old friend Munch be in it?
cos' if their not it won't be the same:(

3.who is the almighty leader of Magog Cartel? is it th prezoomed dead
Molluk? or is it the Gluk's queen?

4.why do you push Abe around all the time? do you do it for pleasure?
or is it reverse phicolagey?(ya' know instead of being kind your nasty
but you mean it with kindness. cos' if you are its not working!)

bye sucker, opps ,I mean bye wise one!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Dear Foolish Mortal, oh, I mean foolish fan, oh, I mean best
buddy, oh... nevermind. Something about your mail utterly intrigued me.
Prezoomed. Presumably, it means to zoom beforehand, to zoom ahead of
time, which is a paradox, because zooming ahead would mean to move
forward, but can you actually go forward in a pre-zoom state? I am
utterly stumped at this abstract concept, so much so that I cannot
continue with the laborious task of answering any more questions,
including the ones in your mail....

Now it's off to think and drink.................

yesterday. Before I was a PS2 fan but XBox is seriously miles better! To
be honest I wasn't expecting much of Munch's Oddysee but I was blown
away! It's brilliant. The standard is right up there and I can honestly
say it's my new favourite Oddworld game. The levels are well done and
the character interaction / gamespeak is incredible. I haven't finished
it yet but I am thouroughly enjoying it! Well done Oddworld and good

bought munch's oddyessy and am very pleased with what i see on the xbox,
which got me thinking why arent the other games on this platform??? why
would u switch consoles? this puzzling question is bigging me, because i
wold really like to play the previous two so that i truly know the story
of ABE. if u could shed some light onto this question of mine id be very
happy \~thanks,Andrew

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Andrew, I'm so glad that you are enjoying the games! And you
want to play the other games on Xbox? This is the most refreshing thing
I have heard of since Mango Iced Tea! It would be great to move AO and
AE over to Xbox. Of course, that would be enough work for an entire
development team and would probably take a few years... If we did it the
fans might get angry at us for not moving forward, after all, we are but
a tiny little development studio... but if MICROSOFT did it... hmmmmm...
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is there any chance that one day Oddworld will produce a game, in
which, there is a time of peace that allows players to further explore
the immense environments only partly explored in the previous games? I
find myself wanting to know more about Oddworld and would very much like
to explore it in depth. This is, of course, just a fan based idea and I
know not how well it would sell in the international market. Well,
thank-you for your time, congratulations on your amazing concept and I
hope to see Abe and the gang again soon. Your devoted, loyal fan; A.
Scott

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I am so pleased to hear how much you enjoy Oddworld and our
environments. Peace and exploring, um, sounds like a wonderful idea but
seems like it would make for really boring gameplay. However, the powers
that be at Oddworld do want you to be able to explore and get to know
Oddworld better. What form that exploration takes could be a number of
things. A game, or ????? We shall just have to wait and see. In the
meantime, it is good to know that true blueish-greenish folksuch as
yourself are excited about the future of Oddworld!

<p><b>Question:</b> Alf, Firstly, I hope you know just how HARD it is to find the
address for Dear Alf. Little did I know that all I needed to do was find
a little bar at the top of the screen in the archives or FAQs with the
little words on it: Contact info. I'll have you know that took ages to
find! Next, I have some questions:

1. Did you purposely put contact info there to make it hard to find

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Ha! If you thought finding the email was hard you should try
getting a straight answer from me!

2:  I've heard about the reason that you cut Abe's finger off, but
how did you get that dismal digit off the moon?

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Hello again alf! Raven here asking if you could clear up a few
questions: Why haven't we heard/seen/smelt/watever anything about Abe's
mother even though the weirdoes (dead mudokens with bones missing)
promised we would know about her when we met munch? They say it when you
finish AE with 300 muds saved.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I'm sure the Weirdos believed that was true, but she's nowhere
to be found and it's pretty frustrating for everyone involved. Makes the
Weirdos look like a bunch of nut cases, or at least more so than usual.
Diversion tactics of a barely lucid and irresponsible mother, in my
humble opinion. Poor Abe. As if he hasn't been through enough already.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf I wish to discuss these questions, By the way I'm Stephen!
Will there be another game before the Steef guy pops up?(such as Munch's
Exoddus.)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Stephen, There shall be nothing but many strong cups of tea
and arduous, strenuous, flatulous work before this game "pops up!"
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will Abe and Munch be in the Steef guy's game?(You can't have a
Oddworld game without Abe and Munch! It would be like Gerbils without
hellium!)

</p>
<hr>

care little for gerbils and less for those who abuse the elements!
</p>

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What are those new chicken characters called?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I know a couple of them characters. Bawhnee Sue McUgly. Unkle
TurkeyToes. Kind of an annoying group if you ask me. Whiny. Loud. Always
scratchin' and flappin' and carryin' on. And not too bright either. Old
Bawhnee Sue sure does make a mean cornbread, though!

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> dear alf why did the modokans let the glukkons walk all over them
?.why should they be slaves?.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The mudokons are a peaceful species with simple desires such
as brew drinkin' and the toob watchin'. Unfortunately, addiction and
ignorance made them much more susceptible to being taken advantage of.
Hence that whole degradation of the species/slavery thing. Besides, what
would you do if a tentacle-mouthed freak with mechanical pants and a big
gun told you to work? YOU'D WORK, that's what!

exoddus) or Shaman (Munches oddysee) and why?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The Weirdos hold a special place this old muds heart. They

<p><b>Alf:</b> Crig is a legend. He spends his days hangin' with Sasquatch
and swimming with Nessy, and hiding from La Chupra Cabra.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Which slig do you like best? Mollucks assistant Toast, Lulus
assistant Valet or the newscaster and why?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Newscaster. He's got style, joie de vive. Is that the last
one? I wanna go home now! Mommy!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> HI man! It is so good to email U! ok I've a few questions to ask
you. In Mo how can you tell which scrab is the alpha scrab?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> He's the one with the big red letter "A" on his chest. Oh
wait, maybe that means something else..
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> is elum in Mo? I haven't got that far butt...or is he i the new
one?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You might see some of the Elum scattered about, in a manner
of speaking, but Abe's Elum has retired. And please don't use that type
of language around here anymore, I mean really.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> is there any cheats ?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yeah, but what do Poker swindling Inhabitants have to do with
the game? Eh?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, (I am russian, sorry about my bad english) I have
rescued all the mudokons in first Abe's game (99) and in second Abe's
game (300). I have a question: why Abe have a sew up mouth, but all the
others mudokons have not sew up mouth?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> When Mudokons were just little hatchlings, they had their
mouths sewn up to hush them. It isn't done anymore, since they are now
free, but Abe keeps his as a symbolic reminder of his past.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, Who or What is Steef??? I see people send in email
saying good luck with steef... But I am completely in the dark when it
comes to this "Steef". Please help me... Phot

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well Phot, I don't know much about him myself. He's very
strange. I hear he smells like a dickens and has bizarre grooming
habits.. but who am I to judge?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi there Alf, could you tell me whether Mudokon ponytails are made
of feathers or hair? I thought it was definite they were feathers, but
as I've discovered, there's no official word on the matter and the fans
seem to be split evenly between the two ideas. Cheerio, And may all the
Inhabitants have a very merry Crimbo (if I haven't actually mistimed
this and sent it in the middle of your break...) Max

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Thanks Max. Right back at ya. Mudokon ponytails, you say?
Why, they are made of sugar, spice, and a bit-o-lice! At least that's
what mummy always told us! \scratch scratch\
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hi alf ElSsAceCon all 4 of us r as odd as ever so we wondered
everyone thinks aliens are cats what do you thinnk about that? could an
oddworld creature be a cat on earth? we think so we also (regarding
someone elses question) believe that there is a portal on earth thanx
alf oddly ElSsAceCon xXxXx

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sorry to disappoint but I would never want to venture off of
this glorious planet we call Oddworld. Not even as a cat. Tempting as
that may seem to some...
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hey Alf! How is Soulstorm Brew? Me and my lazy Mud friends have
never gotten wasted so we wanna know. And hey, you should go and eat
some lone glukkon's head. He's got no arms! He can't defend himself!
Anywho, now for a real question, you seem to hate Abe since you're bitin
off his fingers and pushin him into holes, why do ya follow him when he
calls? Odd bless you -the Maxokon

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Firstly, I never bit Abe, so get it straight, bud! And
regarding that whole well incident, I was never convicted of anything—I
happened to be going in for a pat on the back the moment he jumped. So
wha? And finally, the call of Abe is, unfortunately a biological
phenomena that no Mudokon can ignore. You might say it's programmed in.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I ran into a Alpha Scrab the other day and it seems I misplaced
my arm. is there any place i can go to besides Vykkers labs? I don't
want a chunk of aluminum in my head, unless it's a TV remote. \~ I
misplaced my name too.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Wow. I hope you have good insurance. It's really hard to find
limb donors these days. Maybe you should just get a new name and call it
even. How about Unimud?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Yo Alf! what's up. Thanks for the poetic card I really appreciate
it. I got a few question for you

1. How come Sligs and Glukkons dont get scared in Munches when Abe
chants

2. Does Abe need spooce to possess enemies because he doesn't need to
in the first 2 games and finally

3. Does Abe have health points, you know like those flies on top of
his head or does he just die in one shot.

Stay odd Alf. That is all for now.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hey there fellow chump, you're very welcome! Abe isn't really
all that scary. Ever. Even when he's chanting. The chanting used to come
easy to him, back in the day, but now a little spooce sure helps. You
know what they say, "Spooce does a body good!" And even though he is
pretty fly for a bluish-green guy, I don't think I've ever seen flies on
top of his head.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Wait I got 1 more questions if you don't mind. You know how muds
have they're limit with jumping, I understand but the jumps that Abe
can't survive in the first 2 games weren't that high of a fall and in
Munches oddysee the jumps or falls were a higher distance, so how come
Abe can't survive those falls in the first 2 games(no offense to Abe or
any mud I just wanna know). Stay odd Alf, that's all for now.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The spooce gives Abe increased elasticity and, uh,
sproingability. I can't believe you didn't already know that!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> CHICKENS, I DON'T GET IT! (no, not one of those letters
again.....heheh) Anyway, I was wondering if you are familiar with the
modes of Hindu music known as ragas. Mudokon chanting reminds me very
much of them. So what of the chants the mudokons use? Are they something
we have been taking for granted all along? Could these be a link, or the
big hint that we have been missing all along? \raises demitasse\
Cheers! -Radagast the Brown

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b>  Actually the chanting was inspired by the Shaolin Monks.
And yes, you have been taking them for granted all along. It is so
pathetic that I am just going to tell you what to do, right here, right
now, since it has taken over seven years for you, the chosen ones, to
figure it out: To unlock the BIG HINT, compile all the chants, play
backwards and eliminate every third note. Add the third notes to the end
of each couplet. While listening, plug your left nostril and hop on the
right foot until the room begins to spin. When you see stars, don't
stop! Continue on the path to enlightenment by holding the earlobe of
your neighbor and chanting along with Abe. Rinse and repeat until
desired effect is achieved. Just kidding. There's no big hint. No gooey
candy filling. It's all there out in the open, so if you get it you get
it, if you don't, well then ignorance is bliss.

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Hey alf my man its Joe again! Hey I read some Alf mail from August
2003. One of the questions was how come after you turn into shryskull
and kill all the Gluks in the Magog Cartel conference room how come the
Gluks are still mighty powerful. RITE.AM I RITE! Well after that I went
down and it said who come the Gluks still have all the power and I put
them together and thought of a good question.Since you said they were
like a pyramid and the Gluks were almost at the top poiny part but not
at the top. I went hey theres a good question to ask and here it is. Alf
if the Gluks aren't at the top of the pyramid who is? Oh, and I have
another thing I feel sorry for you having to read all these long
messages.But theres some Odd things in Oddworld that have to be
asked.See ya later Alf.


</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Dear Joe Rite. I see you have done your research and are fully
prepared to annoy me to the greatest extent physics will allow. So all I
can say is: Wouldn't ya like to know!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey, Alf! How is it goin' little buddy? I am missing my yearly
dosage of new Oddworld gossip.....what is the word on the next game? I
want pictures!!! Oh, and have y'all ever considered a comic book to help
on the franchise and make money for a bigger budget on the next
games...hell, even a cartoon will do!! Anyhoo, I was wondering what you
were up to...and since no other fans ask, if you would be interested in
being my new drinking buddy!? Oh, and, how do Mudokans reproduce? I have
only seen male ones.... I think...? Thanks for your time!  
randy

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hey there Randy. We're still working on the game and it's
coming along just swell. Sorry, no new pictures, though. I would be
honored to be your TEA DRINKING BUDDY as that is the only type of
drinking I do, ever, and the only drinking I would recommend, even
though I am not necessarily recommending that you should drink tea,
because it may be a fact that you in particular cannot drink tea, but
then I don't really know, and you haven't really specified, so I don't
really want to commit to that, but if you'd like to have a single cup of
tea sometime I'd be happy to join you. That is, if you are in the
neighborhood.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, I was reading the instruction booklet for Abe's Exodus
and I noticed it said every game will have at least one bonus game with
it, Exodus was the bonus for Abe's Oddysee. I also own an Xbox, and
recently beat Munch's Oddysee, and I was wondering what the bonus game
would be for it, and what the next chapter would be in the series

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There is but one word that can accurately encompass the enigma
that is your question: UNDECIDED.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will you be thinking about doing an abe trilogy just to top it
off?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, I like to think more along the Alf trilogy lines, Alf's
Oddysee, Alf's Exoddus, Alf's Wagon Trip. Then maybe the prequel series,
The Alfster's Menace, Attack of the Scones, and of course, Episode Tea.
Like you said, just to top it off.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What're the mudokon swear words? I know that sligs have a number of
robot sounds for saying bullsh\t, do mudokons have any swear words?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, first off, we don't condone you using any of this filthy
language, but it's pretty much the same as yours, I'm sure ... "What the
Fuzzle?" is a popular one with the kids these days. "Meep Sheet" we
sometimes say in disbelief. A courteous "Odd bless you" following
expulsions from the mouth and nostrils is always appropriate.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Sligs have automatic fire weapons, yet when Glukkons yell "Do it"
They pump their weapons like shotguns.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> If there's anything Sligs know, it's how to operate their
weapon. If they give it a pump, it's cuz they think it needs one. If
you'd like to argue the point some more I'd be happy to set up a meeting
between you and they.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hello Margret! opps, wrong email! Dear Alf, 1.I know I've asked
this before, but i've added a new twist, Lorne said "the next game (with
Steef in it.) won't be apart of the Quintology" does that mean Abe and
Munch won't be in it?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, sort of. Both of those things are true, but I'm not so
sure that one is the result of another. Does that make sense?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2.going on that question, will the Steef person be in the
Quintology?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> NO. And the Steef is not a person, it is a species of noble
beasts!!! And don't you forget it!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 3.why do Sligs wear masks? (apart from protection!) are they blind?
(I used to think they didn't have eyes!)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sligs have horrible allergies but can't afford trendy allergy
meds on a slig salary, so the masks are an affordable way to filter out
heaps of pollutants.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, I am Danny and i was wondering if you could answer me
some things. 1.What happened to Elum? What, did he die or something or
just end up as Fleech food following Abe?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Elum was sent out to pasture where he could toot his horn in
peace.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2.Where did that annoying (yet funny) Slig reporter go? is he a
Valet or something?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There is a Slig Valet and a Slig Reporter. Rumor has it that
they ran off together to start their own mobile reporting
unit.Wockawocka!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 3.And finally... In the name of Odd! Is there any news of Munch's
Oddysee on another console than Xbox? Stay Odd! Danny

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Nope! No news. Maybe you should check with the sligs!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf I've got some questions I've been thinking about for a
while. 1. If Molluck spent two hundred moolah every day for twenty years
without receiving any, would he still have a huge amount left?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, once you factor in inflation, interest and deductions, he
would have, um, let me think, carry the two, divide by the square root
of that, to the third power, would make it somewhere in the neighborhood
of… ASK YOUR ECONOMICS TEACHER!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Number two: Does Phleg have a problem in his voicebox that makes
him only yell and he can't speak normally or whisper? (Because it seems
like it)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Phleg was forced to operate heavy machinery when he was a
child. As a result his hearing is poor, which means he can't tell how
loud he's talking. At least that's what he says in therapy. The truth is
he just loves to be an obnoxious son-of-a-gun.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Number three: Would you go crazy if you had to spend a week with
Humphrey and Irwin? (add Lulu and his slig Valet)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I guess if I survived a week of brutal torture then yes, I
would certainly go mad.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Number four: Can you describe the room that you answer all these
emails in?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Horrid conditions, really. I'm surrounded by volumes and
volumes of various things, some help me answer these ridiculous queries,
others are a pleasant escape from them. Of course there is tea scattered
about and the constant passing of rehabitants on their way to the
kitchen, which I find quite irritating and distracting. Some of them
even have the nerve to speak to me whilst I am writing to you, dear
fans! Can you imagine the nerve? It is hardly bearable. The drone of a
giant air- cooling contraption overhead lulls me to sleep, until violent
outbursts from my neighbors to the east wake me with a start. There is a
tank of fish nearby, but they are mostly gone now. Just what would
appear to be a tiny version of a black and white sea rex.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Last one: Have Bigface, the weirdos, Almighty raisin and Shaman(the
mudokon guide from Munches oddysee) ever met each other?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oh yes, they get together for the Annual Bigfaced, Weirdos,
Raisins and Shamans Convention every year. Don't bother trying to get in
though, it's industry professionals only!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Unimud \~ 3 questions 1. is rupture farms a metaphor for the roach
infested, cow byproduct patty filled Mc(edited for legal purposes)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Woa there unimud! I hate to interrupt but this is not the place
to express your anger at corporate America! That is what underground
film and marginally successful video games are for!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2. Who is the Gluken in green with a country accent?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> That's Tex the Glukkon. He lost the bidding war for the last
can of gabbiar to Lulu.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 3. When can I get this stupid metal thing out of my head? It dosn't
even get good reception!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Alf say: He who puts stupid metal thing in head cannot complain
about reception!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dude, Alf it's so cool to e. mail a mud! now I had three questions.
first, since sligs are so common on oddworld how come the Glukins don't
just cut up THEM up and eat THEIR meat.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I may be going out on a limb here, but I think the metal part
would be too crunchy and cause severe dental discomfort.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> And I was wondering... What are those lump like things on the back
of slave mud's loin cloths?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It is not a lump. It is a fanny pack! In case you hadn't
noticed, even the most fashionable of loin- clothes comes sans pocket!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Shoudn't there be some more info About this"Odd World: Stranger"?
See ya! -Claude the mud

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No! If there were more info he would't be so strange anymore,
now would he?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hi alf! why do slogs, paramites, and scrabs have no eyes?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You know what they say, "When Odd weakens one sense, he
strengthens another!" "The Odd giveth, and the Odd taketh away!" I could
go odd and odd and odd….. Oh, what's that? It's the tea kettle
a-whistlin'! See ya!

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Hey Alf. First, just let me say you're the coolest. Go the tea.
Anyway, i have a few questions:

1) Was Molluck a Big Cheese or a Glockstar?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well it's sort of hard to say. He may have had some of the
credibility and respect of a Glockstar, but his foul odor would lead me
to believe was big (however rotten) cheese. Yes, I'll go with Big
Cheese.

2) At Rupture Farms, the Mudukons were processing huge carcasses, of
creatures too large to be scrabs. What where these?

</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf Its Daz. I was wondering if you and your fellow Mudokons
have benefited from the Magog cartel or their technology at all? Either
using Glukkon suits as carpets, those nice meat drills from Rupture
farms as burglar traps, anti-chanting orbs for pratical jokes or least
slig pants as a new way of bringing your tea to you without leaving your
seat?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, if by benefited you mean being kept as slaves to mine
our own bones and have our lips stitched up then yeah I guess so.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alfie boy my name is Dorian. I just want two ask you 2
questions.

1. what is the difference between scrabs and Alpha scrabs?

2. When will the next oddworld game be released?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Alpha scrabs tell regular scrabs what to do and how to do it!
And I'm not tellin' anything about the next game! Not for all the tea in
Mudos! You can't make me! I--will--not--be--broken!!!!!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, My name is Robert and I was wondering if you could tell
me about the Mudoncho Vaults. I know that it is a temple in Necrum like
the Mudanchee and Mudomo Vaults and that it used to be home to many
meeches (before they were all extinct). But I was just wondering if you
could tell me some more about it? Thanks.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Mudoncho?! Well I know it has been a long time since I was
down in Necrum, and I've had a lot of brew since then, but I sure don't
remember any Mudoncho Vaults! Maybe you got all hot and flustered from
wearing your poncho? Or perhaps you ate a bad batch of nachos while in
the mines? I hear the snack carts there are a little less than
reputable. Watch it!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, I have a query regarding something in Munch's Oddysee. In
the Brewery To Be region, there stands a lone windmill. Found on the
outside walls on the windmill are a red symbol. This symbol is neither
the Mudanchee, nor the Mudomo symbol, yet it is designed in the same
manner. Could you tell me what the symbol stands for, or whom it stands
for (is it possibly the Mudancho symbol)? Thankyou, Alcar...

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Alcar! You're killin' me man! Is this a coup? Are you forumers
messin' wit my mind? I hearby decree that from this moment forward, none
in my Rehab shall speak of the imposter vault known as Mudoncho! As for
the symbol, it is a graphic representation of a Scrab, end of story!
Mudancho! Puhleaz.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, When I was nine, the Oddworld quintology just started,
ever since then, I was addicted. Every mudokon was a wonder to me, and
to this very day this question haunts me: Why does Abe have his hair in
a tail, instead of being tied up, why are his lips sowed up and why does
he have yellow eyes? I't seems kind of-- Odd -- don't ya
think?—levihydra10009

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Aw, that is so sweet! I love it when we can turn a mind so
young so odd. Really warms the heart. Ok, enough of that emotional
stuff, let's get down to business. Abe's hair is in a ponytail for a
very simple reason. Have you ever seen that show, "When Factory Work
Goes Bad?" Trust me, you don't want your hair getting caught in one of
those machines! Always, ALWAYS wear a ponytail! Abe's lips are sewn up
from the old days when no one wanted to listen to him cry. He keeps the
stitches as a symbol of his past. As for the yellow eyes, I'm gonna have
to go with genetics on that one my friend!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hiya Alf! Good to hear from you, you good ol' Mudokon you! I
humbly request your answers to these following questions.

1) Abe has his mouth stitched shut to prevent him from praying, I know
that, but has it happened to other Mudos, having their mouths stitched,
stapled, or (in poor zulags) sellotaped shut?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hey there buddy! Um, well, I just got finished talking about
the stitches. And yes, other Muds have been stitched up, but as far as I
know no one has ever been stapled or taped!

2) Are Fuzzels cuter Fleecehes?

</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 3) How come you are reading, (on your picture) with an electric
light, hmm?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> What are you talking about? My light is powered by adorable
little bugs with glowing bums!

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Dear Alf What is a meetle? Coz you mentioned one before.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> A Meetle is a huge, roundish, hard-shelled creature with four
deadpan eyes. They sure are cute as larvae, but they grow up to be
rather, well, more for function than fashion lets say.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf.It's Brad.I have a few things to ask you. If Abe and Munch
are friends,then how come the fuzles growl at Abe and how come the Muds
laugh at Munch?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Fuzzles are a lot like little dogs, in that they will choose
an individual to bond with. They are capable of bonding with others, but
this alpha figure in their lives becomes the primary source of
attachment. Since Munch is the one who rescued them, they feel
particularly close and downright protective of him. Some who don't know
better may even see Abe as a threat, just because he is different from
Munch.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Are muds primitive?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There are many different groups of muds. Most of us that
you've met so far would be considered primitive by definition. Of
course, I myself am HIGHLY evolved, but I, of course, am the EXCEPTION
due to my tremendous tea making abilities. Now I will impart on you a
secret. I have always sensed that there are parts of Mudos that you and
I have never been to where muds of all kinds have reached varying
heights of civilization!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> It's obvious we're going to discover quite a few new races and
places during our upcoming adventures with "Stranger" the Steef, but
will we discover anything new about those already introduced? Will we
learn more of the Mudokon plight? The Slig Queen? The social order of
Scrabs? The business practices of Vykkers? The fashion sense of
Glukkons? The success of your teas? Or, do Stranger's travels take the
viewer far from all these familiar Oddworld sights, into purely
uncharted territory? —Alex

PS: Is there a central diety in the Mudokon faith, or does your race
revere nature itself?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I think that you will learn much about new species, and a
little bit more about the species you have come to know and loathe. This
game will give you insight into the hierarchy of the no-good-do-ers. The
setting is still in Mudos, but you will see parts of it that you never
knew existed.

And frankly, I am a bit put off that you have the nerve to attempt a
discussion on religion in mixed company! How dare ye!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Ever since I finished Oddworld Munch's Oddysee the second time
this question has been bugging me ... or couple o' questions ...
whatever. Why is Munch's moon upside down? I mean all Abe has to do is
put his hand up to his moon to line it up while Munch has to flop on his
stomach and brake his neck to try and match it up if he's not dead
first. What do you have against the little guy? Unless ... his foot was
on backwards and I just didn't notice. I guess Munch's moon makes up for
it for being bigger than Abe's. Sorry if you find this e-mail offensive
in anyway even though I may have offened you hundreds of times by now. -
Fuzzle

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Howdy Fuzzle. You've never seen this, but when he is feeling
frisky, Munch will often lay on his tummy, little flippity foot up in
the air, and crane his neck around to see the print line up with the
proper appendage. Quite adorable really. And I wasn't offended until you
assumed that I would be! The nerve!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf (red/alfa) I'm a recent fan of Oddworld (It is currently
my second favorite of all time) and I have five questions, the first of
which is considerably more important than the other four.

I recently beat Abe's Oddysse for the first time (I said I was new).
Through a weird computer fluke of some kind, I managed to do it with 100
mudokons. I had been lead to believe that, if I had saved all of them, I
would get a special movie with the Shrink in it. Judging by your
website, the Shrink looks fairly cool, and I hope he appears in future
games. I did not recieve this movie. I got the special movie menu, but
no bonus movie. At first, I thought "Maybe if I only save 99, I'll get
it." That didn't work either. Could you tell me what I'm doing wrong?
Thank you.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> What you are doing wrong is looking for the shrink ... he's
not in any of the games or movies. The clip you are referring to is a
commercial that was never broadcasted. This is what happens when people
(or appliances, or whatever) come to the rehab and act all
shrinkety-dinkety!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will OWI never create anything but Oddworld Games? Just
curious.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> We only create games from Oddworld. I think. Your wiley
verbiage is throwing me off. I can't be held accountable for other
peoples whack-glish.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I heard there is a Abe's Exoddus (which I haven't played yet)
movie (something about short movie showing. Nominated for Academy award.
I've seen movie posters, so I know it exists somewhere. But I have had
no luck in tracking it down at all. If you could help me at all, I would
be very thankful.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yes, an animated short was submitted for consideration to the
Academy Awards, and was shown in a theatre in order to do so.
Unfortunately, I cannot help you track it down. As far as I know, the
only copy is tucked safely under the cushion of my recliner. I'd lend it
to you but it's all warm and covered in crumbs!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will Munch's Oddysse ever be for a pc computer? I don't have an
Xbox.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Nope!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will Hand of Odd be for Computer?... Please ... Well, thank you
for your time. Keep on being Odd. —Andrew

</p>
<hr>

for OHOO. How am I supposed to answer that????
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> In AO and AE, Abe's eyes are white, but in MO, his eyes are
yellow. What happened two him?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> After all the brew was gone, ol' Abey switched to
lem-odd-aide. He drank gallons and gallons of the stuff. Turned his eyes
a freakish shade of yellow! Now he has to use those special strips to
try and whiten them again. Well, at least that's the way I heard it!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> In Abe's Exoddus at the end, Abe says he would save the green
Muds, but We never played as Abe saving them, so has Abe rescued them
without us? —levihydra10009

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sure.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Did Munch ever handle all those baby Gabbits?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I think he is still looking for a can opener.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> At the End of MO, The fuzzles destroy Vykkers Labs. Were the
Fuzzles destroyed, and were Tex and Lulu destroyed (Cos I like Tex)
—Stay Odd, Nathan.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Fuzzles are virtually indestructible, though if necessary
they'd certainly give their furry, fangy little lives for the greater
good. The problem is, they all kinda look alike, and the
fuzzle-to-English translater is still on sabbatical, so we haven't
really been able to ask around and see who made it out yet.

As for Tex and Lulu, well, you know the problem with synthetic textiles
is that they tend to heat up pretty quick. I doubt they made it. If they
did, I bet they'd have permanent sparkle melded to their greedy bodies!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will the Whole quintology be on Mudos? After the quintology is
finished, will future quintologies still have stuff to reveal on Mudos
or will they move on to the other continents.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yes, I believe so, but Oddworld is a big planet. I don't know
about future quintologies. That is pretty far off yet!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do you know of any different breeds of slogs?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Why yes, there are several. Are you ready? There is the Hot
Slog, the Bird Slog, the Muddish Setter, the Hound Slog, and of course
the Snoop Sloggy.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What do BigFace and the Almighty Raisin think of each other?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well I asked them for you. Almighty Raisin thinks Bigface is a
little-faced mud-fink. Bigface thinks Raisin is an almighty windbag with
a sleeping disorder and a pound of denial in every wrinkle. Bottom line
is that respect each other.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How much wood could a woodchuck chuck could chuck wood?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You mean IF a woodchuck could chuck wood? I think it's highly
unlikely, but FOUR.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will Crig the slig ever appear in a game? (or has he already?) -
From Tomohawk

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yes. Crig the Slig appeared in AO and AE. You'd be surprised
- he's awfully shy. He currently is a field reporter for the Daily
Deception.

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Dear Alf, i have been a big fan of Oddworld since i discovered
Abe's Oddysee just before Abe's Exoddus came out. It was one of the many
things that led to me becoming a graphic design student. I have gained
much inspiration from Oddworld, and was deeply excited when I heard
about this Oddworld art book. My question, after all that, is: will the
Oddworld art book be available in the UK?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Wow! That is awesome. It is always cool to hear that we've
played some odd part in a person's life, especially the creative part!
Good luck with your design career!

As for the book, it will be available for purchase from Ballistic
Publishing. Visit their website at
[www.ballisticpublishing.com](http://www.ballisticpublishing.com/oddworldinhabitants/)and
you can sign up for email updates on the status of the book and ordering

<p><b>Question:</b> Hi alf It's Me again Eric(that dude with the Executive Glukkons
Clan), I'm sorry to bother you again,but if hand of Odd is not on the
Production Scedule how come i have 2 videos here where i see Hand of Odd
gameplay(believe me I checked it) well I hope you have an answer sorry
if I have botherd you. In case you want 2 check visit
www.depthsofoddworld.com then click videos en page 1 "Tree Chop",and
"Tree Grow"

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hey Eric, are you getting feisty with Alf? If so I will have
to refer to myself in the third person, and you know Alf hates doing
that! Hand of Odd is still not on the production schedule. I have been
to The Depths Of Oddworld. I have seen the movies. I have the knowledge!
Those movies are pre-Munch. There were several of those—visualizations
of concepts for the game where we were looking at trees growing, testing
wind (no, not that kind of wind, the fresh smelling one) and changes in
seasons, daylight, etc.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, I am confused.

In AO There is a moon with the mudokon's hand on it. Why? And in MO
after, munch saves the gabbits it shows a moon with his foot print on
it. Is there some moon that every hero of oddworld gets with their mark
on it after they save their people? Are the moons some kind of sign of
merit, what is the mystery behind them?If I am true will Stranger get a
moon with his claw or something on it?

I'm sorry but that;s just some part of the games that has never really
been explained.

Your Fan, masterdkp

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Masterdkp, Yes, actually, all the heroes do get a moon. Will
Stranger have one? I do not know that yet. Abe and Munch may have been
the first and last in that tradition. We'll just have to play through
the next game and see! I think of it as a kind of honor, such as having
a bridge or park bench dedicated to you, only on a much grander, cosmic
scale.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf its Justin.I think it would be awsome if you guys at
oddworld would create a oddworld action figure set!
please..please........PLEASE .. consider IT!!!!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yes! Action figures are way cool! Well, not in the sense that
you'll fit in with the cool kids at your school if you carry action
figures around with you, but cool as in "I'm the lord of the geeks"
kinda cool. And ours would be Odd, too, and that's something! I would
love to have Oddworld action figures, especially a little Alf with tea
sipping action! Sip! Sip!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> This is the first time i asked a question so i made it a good
one, firstly, which hand is the paramania and scrabania tattoo on, left
or right, which is which. Second, is abe gonna be in future games
because i would just die if he wasnt in anymore games because he is the
main reason i play. third, i want to make an abe costume for a surprise
for some friends of mine, any tips on how to make it or could you tell
me who could help me, okay thats all?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Scrabania on the left, Paramonia on the right. Stand up, sit
down, fight fight fight! Yeah, sure, Abe will be back someday. I don't
know when, but someday.

Costume: I don't know, but one word of advice: keep comfort and safety
in mind! No toxic paint fumes in the eyes or harsh chemical paints on
the skin, ok buddy?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Now its cool to know that you have a rehab, but thats not what I'm
here for. The new game looks thrilling, and the graphics are heart
stopping. But why is abe not in this game, and will orginal oddworld
creatures be featured in this new game?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Abe is on vacation, sipping non-alcoholic, low-carb, extra
foam brew on the southern isles right now, and can't be bothered. There
will be some creatures that you've come to know and love through the
previous games… we are still on Mudos after all, but I wouldn’t say that
they are the feature or main focus of the game. There's breed after
breed of all new species for that!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi. (dont know if this is the right place to send questions -
couldnt find any other links though). I've been an Oddworld fan ever
since the great work started, I've completed all the games at least
twice, (when I completed Abes Exoddus for the first time i must have
been about 10 years old, i got the bad ending and cried my heart out). I
even have a really cool limited edition Munch's oddysee T-shirt.

Anyway, I was curious as to why Oddworld has sold on Gameboy. I was
looking on e-bay for any cool oddworld gear, and I saw Munchs oddysee
for sale on the gameboy advance! So, how come this is when on the xbox
box it says 'ONLY ON XBOX'?

And my second question - when is the next game coming out? I've read
about a few of the future releases, and I am really looking forward to
them. Is it going to be Munch's Exoddus, Stranger of the Hand of Odd? My
brain is bursting with anticipation, and I look forward to your reply
(and also hope i didnt send this to the wrong place)

Yours sincerely, Fish

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hi Fish, no, you sent it to the right place! That's really
cool that you've been a fan for so long. What has taken you so long to
write?!?!?!

The GameBoy version of Munch is not the same game that is on Xbox. I
guess that’s the best explanation I can give ya.

As for the next game, I love the title, "Stranger of the Hand of Odd".
That is great! Unfortunately, it is something drastically more simple. I
try to tell the marketing folks, complicated and illogical is the way to
go, but they just dismiss my ideas. Foolish hooligans! Anyway, don’t
worry, you’ll get to see Stranger soon.

<p><b>Question:</b> Hiya alf! I have a couple of questions (1 i was wondering what
did you muds do with that blimp abe and his buddys hijacked from vykkers
labs? you could start your own tour of mudos. and (2 in MO at the
windmill area, there's a huge skelleton the scrabs have been pickin at,
what critter was it? that is way too big to be an elum. - yours oddly
deadhead

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Dearest Deadhead, You are an enterprising young lad, are you
not? The blimp has been totally tricked out with dancing teddy bears on
the bow and tie-dyed sails. Munch and Abe took it on their vacation. Hm.
Skeleton, huh? Bigger than an elum… it could be a beached Sea Rex, or a
decomposing Meetle. I'll have to investigate further. In the meantime,
call animal control and get it cleaned up!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf Why Is Abe Blue And his friends Are well You Know Not
—Your Bud Allbadkids

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> So. Bud. You think you're clever, with the "well you know not"
thing. Ok, you are. You kinda made me chuckle there a little bit. Not
tea spewing hilarity, but made me grin. So I will tell you, Abe is Blue
cuz he's the chosen Mudokon. He's no ordinary Mud. Sure he looks like
it, all chumpy and clumsy like the rest of us, but no, he's special. Of
course, they used to tease him about it when he was little, but not
anymore! Ha! Who’s laughin' now, ya not-blue mudokons!!!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf(red/alfa/bert) my name is Andrew. I'm a big time fan of
Oddworld, and am currently devising a website idea. But I have some
questions for you.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Ok An(drew/droid/cillary), shoot.

1.) A very common misconception is that Glukkons have no arms. This is
not true. Glucks have long, strong arms, which they walk on (use as
leggs and feet), because their real legs are shrivled little
worthless...things. I read the official Oddworld Bio for Mollock, and it
said, walks on his hands, like all working-class glukkons. What I want
to know is: is there a higher class of Glukkons that does not walk on
it's hands? Please explain, and feel free to go into exorbrint detail.

</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Well, that is all for now. Keeping drinking tea (a REAL man's
drink), and tell me where you bought your fez. It's cool. Oh, and what
book are you reading (in your portrait) anyway?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I’m reading the Oddworld Licensing Guide so I can try and
answer all your questions!!! Oh, and by the way, my mummy made me the
fez when I was just a lad, so you won’t find one like it in all of
Mudos!

<p><b>Alf:</b> Hello there. I am Abe's brother in the sense that all Mudokons
are brothers, but we aren't directly related, if that's what you mean.
Are we skiny? Is this a combo of skinny and shiny? Because the answer is

</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf, Its Odd-Joe. I have just a few questions after saying that
I love Oddworld and this site, so here they are:

1. In the game "Oddworld Stranger's Wrath" will there be any
connections to the other games such as mudokins or glukkons appearing
that show it is indeed oddworld that Stranger lives in?

2. Why are Abe's lips sown together?

3. I know this is a frequent question, but will there really be a
movie or are you just yanking our chain?

4. Will there ever be a game where you can play
multiplayer/co-operative?

Well I hope you reply. Thanx

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, first of all there will be plenty of connections to the
old games in Oddworld Stranger's Wrath. You are definitely going to know
that this is an Oddworld game. Just because Abe and Munch are MIA
doesn't mean we aren't us. Trust me, that makes sense if you think about
it! What could be more odd than the stranger I ask you???? Not much.
There will be fuzzles, a Vykker, and all of the wonderful ways to smash,
bash, slice and dice those arrogant enough to defy the forces of Odd.
Yer gonna love it! And Joe, really, you should know by now why Abe's
lips are sewn shut- cuz he asked me too many questions! Har! Just
kidding. As for movies and Co-Op play, all I can say is the future is
both unknown and inevitable.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why a western? What is up with that? I'm not really into that
hokey cowboy stuff.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> "Western" is only one of the influences for OSW. Soon you will
see more and more of the regions and levels, where much a much different
landscape is revealed. The journey of the stranger takes him to all
different climates and terrain. Snowcapped mountains, lush forests,
riverside junkyards to name a few. He also encounters all sorts of folks
along the way, with their own, how shall we say, "quirks."
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Can you tell me the different ammo types and what they do?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There are too many to list here! But you can check out their
feature at
[Gamespot.](http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/adventure/oddworldtentativetitle/preview_6114394.html)
Gamespot also has tons of info, screenshots and video downloads for your
viewing pleasure. Check it all out and be the most knowledgeable kind on
the block about an obscure quasi-western video game with a bounty hunter
in it. I'm sure in some places this is the definition of popularity.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What are some of the new species we are going to encounter in
Oddworld Stranger's Wrath?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Wow, there are a slew of 'em. There are the Wolvarks, the
Outlaws, the Outlaw Minions, the Clakkerz, the Grubbs, Gloktigi and of
course all of the live ammos. Wolvarks are kinda like security guards,
but they are totally flaky and would rather nap than work. Of course
they are meaner than all get out and you should avoid them at all costs.
And did I mention that they're ugly? Cuz they are. Outlaws are, well,
just kind of what they sound like. They live outside the law and make
the strangers life so difficult, and yet provide him with a career. I
guess it's that whole balance of nature thing.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How come no one ever writes to you asking about the new game
anymore? Are they tired of your meaningless spiels, your bottomless pit
answers? You're utter lack of decency? Have they completely given up on
you? Do they not realize the veritable slogs trough of information that
you have the potential to be? Shame on them. Shame.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Gosh, I just don't know. With the game coming out next month
you'd think people would be dying to know. Seems like the only mail I
get these days is those friendly offers to enhance my Mudokon-hood or
get a lower interest rate on my rehab payments. Kind offers, really, but
not very useful when all I want to do is blabber on about the game!
</p>

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf i have got a question for you. What's with this
pre-order DVD of Oddworld movies?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hi there. I'm glad you asked! If you pre-order Oddworld
Stranger's Wrath "only the Xbox", you'll receive and "bonus" DVD right

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: What kind of role do vehicles play in Munch's Oddysee? Are there
any water-based vehicles, like boats and stuff? I'd also like to know if
I get to control that awe inspiring blimp I've seen pictures of?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> We're still evaluating the role of vehicles in Munch's Oddysee.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will the Munch's Oddysee environments be more Outside or Inside?
Will there be more small buildings, like guard towers or little homes?
Or large buildings, like factories and stations?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> All of the above! We have massive, sprawling indoor
environments, and we also have smaller guard towers and such dotting our
outdoor landscapes. We're shooting for a balance of indoor and outdoor
experiences.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I would seriously like to know how large the worlds will be in
Munch's Oddysee? Everquest size? Mario64?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> We're still exploring the maximum sustainable size for our
outdoor areas. We feel there isn't much point in having super-large
areas if there isn't anything to do in them. There are trade-offs
involved between the size of areas, the number of characters in those
areas, the complexity of the environments, the presence of facilities,
etc. We haven't quite yet arrived at the magic formula that will let us
answer your question, but we're getting close!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Does Abe get any new tattoos in Munch's Oddysee? What about Munch,
will he get tattoos or any more electronic equipment?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Abe is a supporting character in Munch's Oddysee, and he
doesn't go on the sort of quest that awards new tattoos. Munch does
evolve over the course of the story, but his evolution has more to do
with what he learns about himself and his race than any external change.
Tattoos aren't really Munch's thing, but you never know …
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What is the utility of the thing that Munch has in his head?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The jack in Munch's head was installed by deranged Vykkers
scientists for twisted reasons of their own. Little did they realize
that Munch would find a way to use his jack to control robots, vehicles,
and other machines.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I heard that Mullock is coming back in Munch's Oddysee and that you
visit Rupture Farms…is this true?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I can neither confirm nor deny a role for Mollock in Munch's
Oddysee. A return to RuptureFarms does presently figure in the game.

<p><b>Question:</b> Will Bigface appear in Munch's Oddysee? Will Abe disappear in the
next game (Munch's Exoddus)?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Because this story is about Munch, Big Face does not appear
(Bigface is Abe's mentor). In many ways, Abe has moved beyond what Big
Face can teach him, which is one of the reasons the Almighty Raisin
chooses this time to reveal himself to our heroes. And don't worry –
Abe's story is far from over. He isn't going anywhere soon.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> The Glukkon Queen Margaret is the absolute ruler.  
The Slig Queen Skillya is a wealthy business partner of the Glukkons.  
The Glukkons make up the rich business class.  
The Vykkers make up the rich tech class.  
?????????????????  
The Sligs make up the low paid soldier/police class.  
The Mudokons make up the slave laborer class.  
Slogs and Fleeches are pets.  
Meetles are beasts of burden.  
Scrabs, Paramites, and Meeches are livestock.  
This is Oddworld's modern society as I've been able to piece together.
Notice the blank space? That's where a working middle class would be.
Who are they?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> An interesting evaluation, and largely accurate. Most of the
working class that you mention live in Oddworld's cities, which have yet
to be seen … and those details will have to wait for a future game.

You should also realize that the classes you mention aren't monolithic.
That is to say, while the majority of Sligs are part of a low paid
soldier class, there are also middle-class Sligs.

Likewise, not all Mudokons are slaves. Additionally, there are internal
markets in each of the classes you mention … just because many Mudokons
are part of a slave class doesn't mean they aren't enthusiastic
consumers of Paramite Pies.

Even Mudokon slaves have some discretionary bonus income to spend
(earned for meeting production quotas, or snitching out their fellow
slaves).
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> With businesses such as Rupture Farms and Soul Storm Brew, who
exactly do the $$$-hungry Glukkons sell these products to?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Anyone and everyone! The Magog Cartel is always looking for new
markets to exploit.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> In Munch's Oddysee, will you show the different forms of Mudokons?
Or Sligs in their many stages of life?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You will certainly see a new twist on Sligs. We're still
working on some surprises for Mudokons.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How come Sligs and Glukkons never come close to the Scrabs,
Paramites, or Fleeches, even just by chance? I would want to see the
outcome if they did…

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> In our first two games, this was entirely due to memory
constraints on the Playstation. Our characters are so rich and so
detailed that you can't have more than a few of them on screen at the
same time. We really had to jump through hoops to get as much stuff on
the screen as we did … every time you move from one screen to the next,
the code is busily swapping stuff in and out in the background. It's
almost like pouring water from a gallon jug, into a cup, then into
another gallon jug, over and over again, without spilling a drop in the
meantime. Quite a challenge!

We trust that our new platform will permit us to work with a broader
canvas of characters, although machines being what they are, I'm sure
we'll still be doing all sorts of wizardry in the background to deliver
the most exciting game experience possible.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How did the Sligs get their pants? Did they build them themselves,
or did the Glukkons make them? (and if the Glukkons did, they would have
to sit a bit away from the work area because the length of their arms,
wouldn't they?)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Most of the weird technology you see on Oddworld is derived,
directly or indirectly, from the twisted experiments at Vykkers Labs.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> If the Glukkons (or Sligs) can make pants for the Sligs, then why
don't they make pants for themselves?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Please! No self-respecting Glukkon would be caught dead
tottering about on a gauche set of mechanical legs!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was wondering, since Sligs are first born with an urge to nurture
and this instinct is later beaten out of them, is there a chance that we
will ever encounter “nice” Sligs?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Nice tendencies are ruthlessly sought out and eliminated in
Sligs at a very early age … but you never know. A grub here or there
might slip through the system.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Alf, do you play a role in Munch's Oddysee?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I'll be all around in the dark. I'll be everywhere, wherever
you can look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be
there. Wherever there's a Slig beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be
in the way guys yell when they're mad. I'll be in the way kids laugh
when they're hungry and they know supper's ready and where people are
eatin' the stuff they raise and livin' in the houses they build. I'll be
there, too.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was wondering why Abe was the chosen one to help free all the
Mudokens?…I mean he's really clumsy and stupid.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Odd works in mysterious ways.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> In Munch's Oddysee, in the Vykkers labs can the player interact
with all the specimens in the cages that the Vykkers are experimenting
on (i.e. let them out and make them attack Sligs, etc.)?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Munch can build a little army with all the Fuzzles he releases
in Vykkers Labs.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> In Munch's Oddysee, will Abe and the various other characters have
an extended “Gamespeak?” Will Abe also have different Mystical Tattoos?
If so, what do they do?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> GameSpeak has been both extended and simplified for Munch's
Oddysee, and plays a pivotal role in the game.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What does SoulStorm Brew taste like?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Don't ask me about Brew! I'm still tryin' to forget! Man, one
is too many, and a million's not enough!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I remember a guardian angel in an FMV for the first game. It also
appears now in the Oddworld Universe section of the website. What
relevance does it have to the game? Will the guardian angel appear in
Munch's Oddysee?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The Shrink, as he is now known, was originally part of an early
concept for a television ad for Abe's Oddysee. Nothing goes to waste
here at Oddworld, so I'm sure you'll see the Shrink in a game sooner or
later.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was wondering, in some of the Abe's Exoddus pictures with the
Mudokons hanging upside down on the ‘tear thing', their loin clothes are
staying up? How can that be?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Censor's Glue. It's the same thing that keeps Xena's skirt in
place.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> After the 5th game of the Oddworld Quintology, will there be
something else in store for us Oddworld fans, or is that the end
forever?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I'm sure we'll continue to make Oddworld games as long as we
draw breath (provided they put work stations in rest homes and insane
asylums).
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I heard that Oddworld Inhabitants will make a Squeek's Oddysee.
What can you tell me about it?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Only that it is indeed scheduled to be a Quintology title, and
that it's top secret.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What happened to the Oddworld store with all the cool Oddworld
Merchandise?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Unfortunately our store had to close due to our change of
publishers. We hope to re-open someday.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will the Xbox be compatible with a keyboard or mouse? What is the
release date for Xbox, and how much is it going to cost?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Probably best if you go to the experts on this.

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: hey alf…what happened to the other 4 mudokons i think it was…
that was helping abe at the start of the game when abe fell of the
edge?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yo, did you not get any further than that? He met up with us
later on, we found some cool, clear, refreshing juice in a handy-dandy
dizpenzah, things went fuzzy for a few hours, and then Abe came back and
saved the day. And then we made sure he couldn’t sabotage the SoulStorm
Brewery boiler and handed him over to the Brewmaster. Wait, is that
right? That last part might have just been a bad dream.

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> If humans came on oddworld, how would they be treated? Would
they be captured by Glukkens and be made into slaves and science
experiments till someone gets hungry or would glukkens crap themselves
for seeing strange creatures for the first time?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oddworld is a pretty big place, crawling with life, and
Civilized folks ain’t unused to seeing new and freaky races pop up from
distant shores or hidden places. If humans can prove worthy trading
partners or collaborators, I don’t think you guys would have anything to
fear. I think the better question is “What would humans do?” – you gonna
join their ranks or stand up for our rights?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey alf- I’m unsure if this has been asked in the past.. but are
there any Holidays that Oddworld celebrates? any thing like Scrab
appreciation day or something?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I’ve been pushing to get an Alf Appreciation Day but the guys,
they don’t seem to wanna hear me out. I’m sure they’re just too busy to
recognize their dear savior Alfie. If it wasn’t for me, they’d still be
crawling in the muck lookin’ fer anything fermented. But no, it’s fine.
I’ll just go inventorize my stores.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> When in the name of Odd will you be receiving YOUR own game?
You’ve been riding Abe’s coattails for far too long. Take a stand
already! We’re all waiting for Alf’s Oddysee: the game chronicling your
adventures alongside Abe as you boldly consume tea from the sidelines!

Will they ever make a game about you alf? p.s.: im praying
that you get the raining tea for free

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You know, I’ve always wanted to star in my own game. I would
call it “Oddworld: Alf’s Mudombie Horror MMORPG Simulator 3: The Game
HD”. Basically it’s a point-and-click race-’em-up. Coming soon to
Phantom, Betamax and fairground organs everywhere.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> how good was a mudokon and slig relationship(before sligs were
born in captivity)did muds treat’em badly? I read that there were nice
sligs, will there be a day that Muds and Sligs will become friends?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sligs are petty, vicious, squabbling bullies: you’re asking if
we treated them badly? What do you think, we pulled their tentacles
and chopped their back legs off or something? Sligs have been
poorly-raised broods of nasty work since time began, and that’s not
going to change. Don’t get me wrong, I’ll let one in my teahouse if he
promises to behave, but I don’t think we’ll be building joint communes
quite yet.

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Who does the naming process for all the Mud…lings? Mudokids? Is
it the parent(s)? Do you have some sort of appointed official to hand
out a specific name? It might seem obvious but it might not be, seeing
as your whole lot is a pretty wacky bunch.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sometimes our momma names us, the rest of the time we kinda
name ourselves. I don’t remember ever being told my name, it was just
what everybody always called me. Apart from middle management. They
always called me “Hey you, do ya stinkin’ job ya bum!” I didn’t like
that name. Too wordy.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> As I was reading the April edition of Dear Alf and a question sparked
another: There are bird portals that Abe can use to reach different
areas that definitely don’t contain the Monsaic Sanctum or your famous
tea. What if some of the portals Abe sends the others through take them
to those areas? They’re usually far deadlier than what the current
predicament might be before entering.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oh my odd, that’s… that right there is what they call nightmare
flub! Nah, I wouldn’t worry about it. You gotta trust the birds! The
portals that take Abe to them places, they always stay open for him and
never let anyone else through. They know, man. They know.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Lastly a short question, would you take a bullet for Abe? As in a
fired bullet. From a gun. Fired by a very upset and mean-looking Slig.
Right at Abe. With you next to him. Next to Abe, not the Slig, don’t be
silly. Oops, I guess this wasn’t that short after all.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You know them so-called ‘product delivery firearms’? You might
have seen ’em, the SnUzis and BlitzPackers and that? They strike you
with a dose of addictive goodies and you’re hooked to their consumer
goods, desperate to work in the factories just to get your next precious
hit. I’d take that bullet, then Abe can rescue me and I can cure myself
at my own Rehab. Hyeh, these thought puzzles are fun.

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Do you know what kind of governement the gluckons have? are
they capitalists, democracts or dictators?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Glukkons ain’t politicians, they’re businessers. Obviously
they’re capitalists, use ya head! Each corporate family is ruled by a
Queen, so it’s also a matriarchy and monarchy.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Dear Alf how you doin’? I have some questions to ask you:
first is about Glukkon, if they are a armless species how did they dress
themsalves?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Personal assistants, or personal slaves depending on taste.
Some have a Slig PA to be their hands. Others keep a Mudokon in their
office. Never underestimate the gratitude of a slave who doesn’t have to
work down in the giblet tracts like the others.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Glukkons look really.. dry, as if they are
dehydrated. Really wrinkled lips. rough skin, etc. Why are they like
that?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You’d think if it were a big problem the Vykkers would have
them hooked on hydrating beauty cream and revitalizing dermal gels.
There’s a big market in making people feel shoddy about themselves, and
kid, I think you’re tuned into this big style. Now come up with
something to make Wolvarks buy more toothpaste.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Are there glukkon cities away from the factories?
like, only residential cities? If not, so where do glukkons sleep, eat,
etc.? Do they live in the same society as vikkers?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The big cities are places we haven’t seen yet, but it’s not
just Glukkons and Vykkers. These are hugely cosmopolitan places, hugely
commercial too. Then, y’know, there’s the private villas and estates,
the lakeside holiday homes, the gated communities. Whatever takes ya
fancy when your wallet’s thicker than a Nolybab pop star.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, this question’s been bugging me ever since I finished
Stranger’s Wrath. If Glukkons have a queen (Lady Margaret, correct?)
then I would believe the majority of other Glukkons are genderless with
possibly a few male drones. If this is the case, how are Glukkons able
to breed with Oktigi to spawn Gloktigi?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Through the timeless method of the business deal, of course.
Biologically you’re spot on, so I don’t see what you’re having trouble
wrapping your head around. You get a Glukkon, you get an Oktigi, ta da:
baby Gloktigi!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Mudokons adore music, it’s one of our most favourite things.
We’re one of the most musical species out there. Our native languages
are melodious, a lot of our technology works because of harmonies, and
we love to dance to the beat of the drum as much as anyone. Not to say
the rest of Oddworld ain’t swimming in music, from nature, from natives,
even from the Civilized world.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey alf who is the mudokon in the tree in the forest after
Soulstorm™ mines and will new’n’tasty be a part of The Oddbox?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hey Viktor, let’s look at your questions one after the other.
Let’s start with the Mudokon in the tree out in Necrum. Unless you
suffered a sudden bout of not really being aware of things in general,
you’re probably not thinking of Abe. Abe was out there alone, so if you
did see someone else, go and find either an optician or an exorcist. I
suppose there were the ghosts Abe freed from traps, if you believe those
daft stories of his anyway, maybe that’s what you’re thinking of. Or
else, I dunno, maybe it was just a random carving. Ancient Mudokons are
kinda well known for their sculptures, ya know?

The Oddboxx is a compilation of the first four Oddworld games, and since
New ‘n’ Tasty is—guess what!—new (and also really quite delicious), it’s
not part of the Oddboxx.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey alf! I love your work and I was wondering, where do mudokins
learn and study? Are there universities for them? What fields are
popular? Are there any overpriced modos history textbooks I can buy for
way to much moolah?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Like the rest of my fellow slaves, my practical education came
from being dumped on the job and beaten every time I goofed up. You
learn quick to avoid punishment. Our more ‘academic’ knowledge came from
propaganda and misinformation. The newspapers and TV shows we’re allowed
to enjoy are all carefully constructed to make us think we’re living a
great life. It’s all the education we need to be as productive as they
want us to be.

Back out in the wild, our cultural heritage is passed on through
different means. Ancient knowledge and history is primarily passed down
by mouth, told through stories around the fire or on long journeys. If
you wanna take it to the next step, you go find the recorded history:
the carvings, the rockart, the architecture. You spend time in nature,
observing the plants and animals. You meditate and teach yourself how to
intersect with the spirit world. There’s no expensive laminated
textbooks or poorly scheduled exams here.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> \#DearAlf where did the name “Mudokon” derive from?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hey, thanks for using the brand new \#DearAlf hashtag! More
people should use the \#DearAlf hashtag! Hey everyone, use the \#DearAlf
hashtag!

Mudokons are named after the continent of Mudos, where they come from.
Like how you lot are all Earthikons. That’s what you call yourselves
ain’t it? I don’t really pay attention.

Mudokons? Do you have some way to teach this language to an earthling

<p><b>Question:</b> #DearAlf How did Abe get employee of the year at
RuptureFarms just by being a floor waxer? Plus, what came with the
award?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Just by being a Floor Waxer? JUST?!! That’s a tough job for a
Mudokon to get! Abe paid his dues and learned all the tricks as a Junior
Floor Waxer. Plus, Abe was THE Floor Waxer. Those floors were so shiny
that they’d blind anything looking directly at it. Good thing that’s
what he was supposed to do… I’m sure if the wrong person went blind, Abe
would have been Most Wanted long before his Oddysee. What came with the
award? Only what was prized most: less slig-beatings.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is the reason Abe was employee of the-month at Farms
really just because he is two-elevenths Glukkon on his half-uncle’s
side.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yeah right! Like Glukkons would cut anyone who’s not a purebred
a break. I bet they don’t even remember Abe’s roots…
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What do Mudokons eat and drink?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Mmmm food. Now we Mudokons are creatures to be envied there.
You should know the answer to this one; our delicacies are known and
prized and envied across the universe! Scrab Cakes, Paramite Pies, and
Meech Munchies for all!

Speaking of all that food—geez, I haven’t eaten in days. Need to get my
hands on… well, all of those delectable bites and scarf them all down
before I eat my own head!

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Can Munch talk and if so will it be the same as Abe?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Munch speaks, he is a simpler creature than Abe, and his speech
is simpler, as well.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was wondering, since Munch is the last of his species, how
will he reproduce without others of his species? Does he even need
another Gabbit to reproduce? Is he a hermaphrodite or something?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> One word: Gabbiar!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Are there going to be any babies in Oddworld Munch's Oddysee like
baby elums, scrabs, paramites or any other babies?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Not in Munch's Oddysee, but various Oddworld grubs may feature
in future games.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Can you in Munch's Oddysee morph into the sligs , scrabs ,... like
in Abe's Oddysee and Abe's Exoddus ?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> If by "morph" you mean "possess", then yes. If by "morph" you
mean "change into the Shyrkull," then maybe. If by "morph" you mean
"Murph," the guy who works at the filling station, then I can't help
you.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Are there females of your kind? Please answer the questions and
keep up the good work and keep it ODD ;-)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Our Queens are female.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> You still haven't replied to my last message and I'm getting a
little pissed off. I live in Sydney, Australia and I'm wondering when
Munch's Oddysee will be released here. Could you tell me?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sorry mate! I'm doing my best to find out for you but we just
don't know yet. Don't look for Munch to be in the Outback until 2002.
When they tell me, I'll let ya know. G'day!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Did Oddworld Inhabitants create an Oddworld movie yet? If someone
can please send information if you can. I am obsessed with Oddworld. and
I think that Oddworld Inhabitants should make a movie. tell me what
website I could by the movie at if possible. it would make my dreams
come true.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> A theatrical short subject was composed by drawing images from
Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus and connecting them together with some original
bridging material. The film was screened for a short time in October
1998, Los Angeles, California. It may or may not be made available
through other venues in the future.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How Do Paramites, Scrabs, and fleeches see? They all don't have
Eyes.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There are alternative means of "seeing", echolocation, for one.
Plus, just because you can't see a set of eyes doesn't mean they aren't
there, somewhere ...
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Are there poor Glukkons?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There are quite a few disgraced Glukkons who have gone for
broke and leveraged themselves into poverty É most have the dignity to
do away with themselves, but there are a sad few who hang on at the
bottom of the corporate ladder, a disgrace to their betters and a target
of derision for the masses.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Who are Interns?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Surgically prevented from whistling while they work, Interns
are finger-pointing finks who enforce Vykker regulations with a song in
their heart and a pill on their lips. When not pilfering from medicine
cabinets, these sleep-deprived, self-important slaves yearn for the
latest in fashion swimwear, punk rock, and designer pharmaceuticals.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How much is Quintology (I didn't found in any dictionary) ?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> My dictionary defines Quintology as "what you say when
'quintet' doesn't sound cool enough."
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> When will Hand of ODD will be released?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sometime in the future. We are concentrating on Munch right
now. After Munch I'd like to add a den and redo the kitchen at Alf's
Rehab & Tea, learn how to fly fish, then think about Hand of Odd.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is Alf's Rehab & Tea a separate game or part of Munch's Oddysee?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It is a location on Oddworld that will be featured in many of
our games.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> You mean to tell me that all Mudokons, Glukkons, and Sligs come
from their own queen? So, you have never experienced the joys of love
and sex. I pity you!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Thank you, Mr. T.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How come Abe is blue and you, along with all the other Mudokons,
are green?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It either has something to do with my diet, or it's a bit of
dramatic license to help Abe stand out from the rest of us...
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What will happen if both Paramites and Scrabs meet?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> On your old Playstation, there would be a memory overflow
causing the game to crash. In Munch's Oddysee, you can expect a vicious
Inhabitant hoedown!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Man! I just looked at the munch demo video off fileplanet... it's
amazing! i love it, the camera zooms in on the back of munch's skull and
i still can't detect a pixel. How often do you think you'll be posting
new videos on your site as the release date nears?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> As often as we can spare time from preparing the game to post
things to the site. Keep checking What's New.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How big are the characters in Oddworld compared to humans?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Abe is roughly human-sized - you can extrapolate from there.
Check out the chart above.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> The Oddworld games are the best games ever made. I have finished
them all in everyway. When I heard Munch's Oddysee was coming out for
PS2, I scrambled to get one. Now the game moves to XBox. In your Mission
Statement, it says that you people want to get Oddworld into every home.
How will that be possible for PS2 owners?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The same way that it will be possible for Dreamcast or Nintendo
owners: by buying an Xbox.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I'm very disappointed right about now its been called to my
attention that I haven't seen or heard anything about those loveable
creatures the slogs. Please say they aren't gone and don't you dare say
the fleeches have taken there place. Please don't disappoint us!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Fear not! Slogs are already in the game, running about,
barking, eating Sligs, getting chopped up in recyclers, they'll
definitely be on hand when the game is released!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I am making a model of munch but I can't do the back part of him
could you send me a back front and side picture of munch I am SORRY I am
bugging you but please alf, I'm your biggest fan.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> What some people won't do for a butt shot of Munch! OK – here
you go! (See above pop up image)
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> When Molluck loses his clothes does he have has 2 big arms or 2 big
legs because they only show it for a second I know that there are 2
small ones.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Glukkons walk on their hands. Their legs are vestigial.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf ,will there be any Mudokon freeing in Munch's Oddysee?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Absolutely!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Can you please tell who or what is The Magog Cartel?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The Magog Cartel is an association of Moolah-mad capitalists
bent on the mercantile conquest of Oddworld.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is it pronounced as "Munch" as in \The sound of someone eating\,
or "Munch" as what it may be pronounced in German with a bit of the
short \oo\ sound?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It depends on whether or not a German is saying it. Note, also,
that Latamire Munch is not to be confused with Edvard Munch, the
Norwegian painter known for his evocative treatments of psychological
themes and for his influence on the development of 20th century German
Expressionism.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> There was a question on "nice" sligs. Well, if "A grub here or
there manages to slip through the 'system'", who would care for it?
Sligs are born without legs yes? If growning up from grubs (?) and
walking with their hands, would they develop arms like the Glukkons?
(Keeping in mind the "pants-spoiled" Sligs drag themselves- they didn't
grow up developing "their" arms)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Like many wild animals, Slig grubs are born into the world
fully equipped to survive on their own. They only need caregivers for
political indoctrination, and while mechanical pants are nice, Sligs
have survived for generations without them.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> In Abe's Exoddus, Elum isn't in the game! I was shocked! What
happened to him, and is he in Munch's Oddysee?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> On the Playstation, Elum was an expensive character
(memory-wise) for what he brought to the game, so he didn't make an
appearance in Abe's Exoddus. We still plan for Elum to appear in Munch's
Oddysee.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What about Habitales and Farietales series?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> What about them?  - The End

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: I’m curious about something, are all Mudokons male?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Geez, I really didn’t ever want to do this, but if you haven’t
had the talk about when a Mudokon loves a Mudokon… Looks like I’m
getting cut off here. Let’s skip that step, shall we? Yes, there’s
female Mudokons—we all come from somewhere no? Our females are queens
who do all the reproducing. The Mudokons you’ve encountered in the past
aren’t male, we’re just gender-neutral workers. From what I’m told, it’s
pretty similar to how bees and ants work on your Earth-planet. Except
we’re bigger, cooler, and much better looking than those guys.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> #DearAlf Is Abe the only Mudokon with Stitch-Lips?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Good ol’ Stitch Lips! I gotta start calling Abe that more
often. Honestly? I’m not sure if he’s the only one. Surely he couldn’t
be the first or the last Mudokon that cried so much as a baby that Sam
sewed his mouth shut to keep him silent for the guards. But who knows?
We’ll have to find that one out together…
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> #DearAlf Has Munch a girlfriend? And where is the
women’s in Oddworld Universe?(except the Jil momma from stranger
wrath)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Munch is quite single… and loving it! That little Gabbit guy is
living the dream. But if you know any smart, beautiful Gabbits to set my
man up with, let me know and I’ll hook ‘em up. Munch and I are tight
like that. And don’t you worry—there are women in the Oddworld Universe!
Of course we’ve got Sam, our Mudokon Queen (hey, Mom!). There’s also all
the Clakkerz on Stranger’s side of the planet. Just because you haven’t
met the rest of the fine ladies of Mudos doesn’t mean they’re not there!
We’ve got ‘em in abundance, they just haven’t surfaced too much in what
you’ve seen… yet.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> #DearAlf What job do Sligs have (besides beating the
workers)?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Other jobs: Slapping the workers, Smacking the workers,
Shooting the workers, Harassing the workers, Kicking the workers,
Punching the workers, Elbowing the workers, Karate-chopping the workers,
Making fun of the workers’ really fashionable fezzes… Annnnnnnd I think
I’ve covered all their other jobs.

Alright! Friday down. You mean there’s another one coming up next week?
Well good thing—there’s always questions to be answers, mysteries to be
solved, tea to drink, and… hey you, give me back my wallet!

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Can I mate with Stranger?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> What is this, Match.com? Stranger’s a free Steef – just as much
of a free bird as you are. We’re not just auctioning him off here – he’s
no Mudokon slave. But if you’re asking about logistics of having a
Steef’s child? It depends on a few things. Is it legal in your country
to mate with a Steef? Must you be married first? And is your body
equipped to hold a Steef embryo? What is the birthing process like for
your species hybridized with a Steef’s? These are some things to look
into. Check with your local Vykker for details.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why are Sligs called Sligs and Glukkons called Glukkons?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> A Slig is a Slig because it’s a Slig. And a Glukkon’s a Glukkon
because it’s a Glukkon. You’re a Ricardo because that’s what Ricardos
are, amirite? But would the beating of Slig feel so brutal if a Slig
went by any other name? Would Glukkons’ greed be so solipsistic if they
weren’t called Glukkons? Would Meech Munchies be as delicious if we
called them Fart Flurries? Is anybody listening? Is this thing on?

@Q: \#DearAlf Can you say what’s the real name of Stranger?
And who was that octopus that was controlling the Sekto?

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: I was wondering on something about Abe. Abe is able to possess a
Slig’s or Glukkon’s or Paramite’s or Scrab’s body with chant, that’s
clear. But what happens if Abe is killed while his soul is in one of the
bodies? Is he trapped then in that body forever?! I’m asking this
because while chanting I saw those pretty little lights around Abe, and
I’m not sure if it’s his spiritual power’s appearance or it’s Abe’s
soul.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Dead is dead. So if his body’s found and someone kills Abe,
he’s a goner—soul in another body or not. Otherwise, anytime he’s about
to get 86’d, he could just possess someone near him and just carry on,
you know? But wait…why are you so curious? Are you planning something?
Did you already DO something?? I need to make a phone call… Make sure
this guy I know is doin’ ok…
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Talking about chanting, are the other Mudokons able to chant like
Abe? If so, can they possess other beings just like he does, or there
are other levels of this chanting ability – besides possessing another
creature?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Pretty much all Mudokons can chant. We’re pretty cool, eh?
Possession on the other hand is a fine skill that shamans practice their
whole lives to be able to hone and refine. Abe’s a wonder-mudokon,
though, and picked it up in a snap. He’s a natural.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Just curiosity, first of all, I love those rock paintings and
drawings what you guys did at Monsaic Lines, Scrabania and Paramonia.
What kind of tools did you use to make them? We, humans used stones,
blood and different kind of plants or fruits which had paint-like mass.
Do you do any artistic activities in your tribe like painting or
handcrafting?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Similar to you Earthenites, we use stone and metal tools, dyes,
plants, animals, and good ol’ fashion dirt—depends on what tribe of
natives you talk to. Some tribal crafts that the natives are known for
are Meep crochet and Meep leather goods, leaf origami, Elum dung
sculptures, and Scrab bone carvings.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> About Oddworld’s wildlife: Have you ever tried to tame any wild
creatures so you can use them as a help in your tribe or maybe a cute
pet? For example: Elums are useful for travelling, as I know it from
Abe’s first adventure in Paramonia and Scrabania.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, you just said it! We train Elums for help. Meeps are
silly little livestock that we use for food and goods. Hypothetically
Mudokons can tame Paramites, Scrabs, and Meeches, but it’s very
dangerous and it’s not recommended—you better be an expert and you won’t
catch me doing that anytime soon! Outside of the natives, there’s the
Fuzzles, Boombats, Chippunks, and all the other little critter-dudes
that Stranger uses as Live Ammo. I’d say those are pretty dang helpful.

Well folks, we had a lot more questions this week that didn’t get to be
answered but you know what? That’s what next week is for! See what I did
there? Now I know I’ll see your faces again, same time, same place. I’ll
be counting down the minutes until then. Miss ya already.

Got more questions? Well that’s just dandy. Just ask me at @OddworldInc

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: I know that Glukkons have shriveled legs, and use their arms to
walk, therefore not having a free hand… but what if, (and would…?) a
Glukkon were to buy and surgically attach mechanical arms to themselves,
therefore giving them the freedom from having slaves/Sligs do
everything?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Beeeeez, this has gotta be in the top five questions I ever
get. Lemme ask ya, if your social life was cigars and brandy in mahogany
rooms, would YOU wanna be the one to annihilate the class with your
clunking industrial pliers for arms? And if your social ladder was built
out of how many chumps you can get doing everything for ya, would YOU
wanna be the loser who starts doing things with your own paws like a
Cavegluk? Well maybe ya would, but you’d make a dreadful Glukkon.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I found some Mudokons throwing some Sligs into a
Splinterz brand tree ‘recycler’ with the following ‘types’ of junk on
its display – Meat, Scrap, Bone, Fat, and Fluids. Nothing about trees.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> That would be scrap. Scrap metal, scrap wood, scrap stone,
scrap flowers, scrap art, scrap health and safety regulations: it’s all
stuff fer makin’ stuff. Meat’s fer eatin’, bone’s fer ‘splodin’, fat’s
fer burnin’, fluid’s fer I dun even wanna know, but scrap is the rest of
it fer doin’ everythin’ else.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> With so advanced tech, why hasn’t any creature from
Oddworld created any kind of spaceship yet?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Space? Why are we going to space? Are there intergalactic
Mudokons that need rescuing? Lots of forests to chop down on the moons,
are there? Loads of Space Fuzzles to abduct and run stardust experiments
on, right? No? None of that? None of anything that anyone needs or
wants? Oh great. Let’s go anyway for some reason. They serve tea at
least, yes? NO!? Well in that case let’s go right now! Imma be the first
Mudokon to open an orbital rehab!

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Is the reason Abe was employe of the month at Farms
really just because he is two elevenths Glukkon on his half-uncle’s
side.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hahaha, you teaphiles crack me up! Yeah right, like Abe’s
distantly related to a Glukkon. You’ll believe anything I say! I bet if
I told ya I was half-Paramite you’d stand behind me for hours waitin’
for an arc of silk to start knittin’ yur winter woolies. Nah, I’m only
stirrin’ yur sugar. Beez, lighten up!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I heard some rumors flying about that Mullock wasn’t
killed in Rupture farms, is he still alive.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You really shouldn’t believe what you read in the tabloids. I
mean it, that fact-fearin’ snaggle of agenda-pushing tosh spewers should
be ignored at all costs. They love drumming up public interest in a
topic they can exploit, and boy oh boy is everyone interested in what
became of Molluck. The list of people who want to find him alive just to
have him shot is longer than Buddy’s belt. But seriously, by the same
token how can they not have found him? RuptureFarms is big and
labyrinthine but it must have been pulled to pieces by vigorous search
crews by now, and they haven’t found so much as a pair of fluffy
slippers. Face facts, he’s toast.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Also If those mudokens can make that storm at the end of
Abes oddysee to destroy rupture farms, why don’t they just do that all
the time?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Because it takes a lotta Spooce! Luckily RuptureFarms is pretty
darned close to the Mudokon holy caves of Monsaic Lines, filled with
cranky ancient shamans and freaky psychic machines. Multiply by a not
small number of rescued Muds all too happy to see their former enslavers
electrified, and you’ve got a recipe for the worst weather-related meat
factory mishap since Unckie Chunky hisself famously lost 8 thousand tons
of Meech Shank to a flash flood. Oh, it can be done with a lot of
planning, but an ever-growing proportion of free Muds are too busy
celebrating life to give half a care to organizing rebellion. Plus you
don’t wanna set fire to a building filled with workers, and there are
very few daft enough to infiltrate a functioning Glukkon facility and
get away again with the whole labor pool in tow.

my old tea-addled brain… but didn’t he… didn’t we figure out he’d been…
Grubb-in-a-tub, this is awkward. I don’t want the nippers to start
cryin’, so I need to find a way to put this tactfully. I’m sorry to have
to tell you this, but we had to say goodbye to our beloved Elum. It’s
tragic and horrible and quite unbelievable, but it’s true. He decided to
go to medical school.

<p><b>Question:</b> Is soulstorm brew only consumed by mudokons?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No siree, it is not. In fact, it’s the number one beverage in
the whole of Mudos, enjoyed icy and fizzing by all from the surliest
crate packer to the tenderest wallet stitcher. Bottles of Brew are
wielded by every stadium hawker this side of Mudos Arena and stood
clinking in the chiller of every light-flickerin’ dehab from Nolybab to
Fegas. Short answer: No siree, it is not.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Abe could use his posseseion anytime he wanted in the first two
games how come he requires spooce to possess in MO?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I guess you never saw Abe’s condo back in RuptureFarms, didya.
I tell ya, that chump never looked after it properly. He had the
flashiest home outta anyone, on account of bein’ Employee of the Year:
5% more bedding than the next best place, three whole options on his
private Vendo, a bigger CCTV screen by a good quarter inch, and it was
strung up higher than anything else in the silo. What does he do with
it? He lets it get overrun by Rats, Slurgs, basically any pest you could
name. I spotted him feeding the varmints more than once. And the mould!
He just let it grow, like he was culturing a carpet of the icky stuff.
He was probably breathing in enough Spooce from that stuff to power his
campaigns against RuptureFarms and SoulStorm Brewery. After that, I
ain’t surprised in the slightest he had such a massive hankerin’ fer the
stuff.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do Vykkers fall in love with themselves?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They’re born in love with themselves. Not in the icky, squicky,
opple-sticky way you or I—well, you maybe anyway—would. Just they really
like ’emselves is all. They’re chronically incapable of empathy, even
between each other. All they’ve got room for in their twisted hearts is
themselves. But you’re right, Vykkers are self-impregnating
hermaphrodites—given their selfishness, can you imagine anything else?
They can only do this for a couple of months out of their long lives,
which they take as a sabbatical from work.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> If Abe and Munch took down Vykker’s labs then does that mean
that Strangers story existed before Abe and Munch journey?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I’ll pop the kettle on while I have a think about how that
makes sense. Maybe head out and collect a couple sacks of berries, too.
Hey, do you want anything from that other village way across the other
end of the mountain range?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why have the only creatures that have been seen in both
stranger’s wrath and the other games been fuzzles?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Fuzzles are pretty ubiquitous critters, you’re likely to find
them in all sorts of places across all of Oddworld. That’s one of the
reasons they’re so perfect for the Vykkers to collect in massive
numbers. It just so happens they’re as common in the dust plains of
Western Mudos as they are in the contested plateaux of the Outter Rim.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I noticed on that one Stranger guy’s hat is that he has
darts. Why doesn’t he ever use them?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Because then his hat would be unbalanced, duh.

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: are meeches really extinct? like for reals? \#DearAlf

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It’s hard for some chumps to accept change and loss. Look, I
get it. I once lost a stinky job in a meat factory. I was lost in the
desert for a whole day at one point. I recently lost the key to one of
my store cupboards and the smell seepin’ from there is really startin’ a
drive the patrons away. But we gotta learn that these things are lost
forever and that we have to adapt. I’ll never get that day back. I’ll
never suffer in a factory again. I’m gonna need to buy a lotta air
fresheners. It won’t be easy and it won’t be instant, but we need to get
ya to learn: Meeches are gone forever. Sorry, bro. It’s just how
extinction works.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I haven’t seen Meetles/Mugs around. What happened to
them?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well they ain’t extinct for sure, but they ain’t exactly common
either. The places y’all have probably been looking for ’em are likely
wrong. If the Vykkers or Glukkons have been about, all them Meetle grubs
will have been taken away for experiments or repurposing respectively.
And if the factories you’re lookin’ at are really just little far-flung
Outer Rim underfunded startups by financial noobodies, they ain’t gonna
be guarded by Mugs. So that’s what happened to ’em and why you ain’t
seen ’em yet.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do vegetarian Scrabs exist?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hahaha, you got some spooced out concepts shakin’ it up in yur
brain cavern. Oh Muddy, that little number’s gonna keep me laughing all
through winter! Vegetarian Scrab, HA!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf! What is the situation on Mudos now that the Magog
Cartel is failed?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Dude, look out the freakin’ window! There are factories
entrenched tick-like across the landscape, natives enslaved in every
corner of the continent, vast tracts of the world rendered
uninhabitantable by centuries of devastation, and the billionaires are
laughing from their sunlit offices and penthouses. You go up to the
Magog Cartel HQ and throw a jeer at it, see for yourself how failed
they’re feelin’ right now.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> And lastly where can I acquire the A.L.I.V.E. engine?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> That’s not really something you can get yer hands on, because
it’s not something we’ve made available, freely or otherwise. Plenty of
reasons why. That said, there’s a bunch of really dedicated fans out
there who have spent hours of their free time rigging together tools
that let you make changes to Abe’s Oddysee and Abe’s Exoddus.
Effectively they’ve made a level editor! Go run a few queries on your
search engine o’ choince and check it out! Now if we went and released
the A.L.I.V.E. Engine now we’d be wasted all that hard work o’ theirs,
and that’d just be rude.

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Green Tea? Fan or foe? No tough on your rehab tea I’d bet!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It’s all part of a healthy tea diet. You should drink five
portions of tea a day. Drink teas of different colors to make sure you
get a full range of vitamins and minerals!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi, Alf! Hope you’re doing well. I was wondering, when and
how did you come up with the tea you sell today? I’m assuming after your
adventure in the desert?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It took some trial and error, a bit of time and a lot of
patience, but my unrivaled recipe is simply the best concoction for the
job. I looked to ancient wisdom of plants, consulted the elders, and
frankly I had no shortage of Brew-addled souls to help before I achieved
perfection. But I got there, and now there’s no limit to the help my tea
can do. I once cut my finger on a dangerously-suspended dream catcher
and tea made it heal real fast, I swear it’s true!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I’ve been wondering for quite some time, what does Soulstorm
brew taste like? Does it taste like bones? That doesn’t sound very
appealing, least of all intoxicating to me.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It’s like candied mouthwash, babbling over your tongue like
pristine springs in sparkling sunlight. It’s like a father figure giving
you a relaxing and electrifying pat on the back and saying “You’re
amazing. You’re doing brilliantly. Don’t stop now.” It’s like the
torrent of relief and release swirling down your throat is pushing you
up, up, up but before you know it you’re sinking down, down, down. I
hope I’m putting you off.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Who are the main consumers of glukkon products, like
paramite pies, soulstorm brew, etc.? Are they other glukkons?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Glukkons, sure, they’ll eat ’em behind closed doors. Glukkons
don’t tend to eat in public, their table manners aren’t generally held
in high regard. Sligs love the stuff, but they gotta consider company
policy. It’s unprofessional to be seen supporting another company’s
products. Not without a big, fat marketing deal that is. But you should
see the junk food they stash in their bunks! Mudokons don’t get a
choice, it’s addictive own-brand or nowt. The real customers are the
Khanzumerz in the big cities. That’s where the real Moolah comes from.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf! I was wondering if you could shed some light on
flavors of certain snacks and drinks you’ve tasted like Bone Brew,
Paramite Pies, and any other snacks you may have tried..?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Look, these cheap throwaway products aren’t exactly crafted
with artisan subtlty. A Paramite Pie is Paramite meat in a pie, with a
whole bunch of jelly, salt, preservatives and other things I don’t
recommend putting in yourself. They taste good for a bit, but that’s it.
I have no pleasant memories of enjoying a Paramite Pies. Not now I know
there’s so much out there cooked with love and attention. Quit dwelling
on this mass-produced garbage and go experience the rich variety of
food! And bring me back something nice and tasty.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Also can you share the recipe for your tea?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oh hey, sure thing, partner! Here’s instructions on how to
replicate my products entirely. I’ve also included a free sample of
ingredients to help get you started. In fact, let’s make it a lifetime
supply! Why don’t you just move in and take over my life’s work! NO, GET
OUT! MAKE YOUR OWN TEA!

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Hey, Alf. How’ve ya been? I have another couple questions: Can
you tell us about Buddy the khanzumer? What’s he like, and should I bake
a cake for him?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Buddy’s the best! Well, he ain’t exactly the saviour of his
race, but he’s a damn cool kid anyway. I’ve never seen anyone keep
either a hackey sack or a webserver up for as long as he can. You should
totally bake him a cake. He loves cake! But don’t mean and call him a
Khanzumer, b’okay? He may be a little weighty, but there ain’t anyone
who deserves to get compared to that lot. Buddy’s a Mudokon. Budokon?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Can you tell me what Buddy’s voice is like? I imagine it being
very deep and smoooooth. Also, anything else you can tell us about
him?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Buddy’s so boss, Buddy’s so bass, Buddy’s so deep he’s deeper
than space! Haha. I came up with that on the spot. Bud’s a super scout,
donchaknow, can get a whole forest mapped out in his head down to each
and every tree. So what if it’s not perfectly accurate when he puts it
down on paper? So what if it made all them tourists get lost in the
woods? Point is, no one else has the dedication and perseverence to
actually make that map in the first place. I doff ma fez at ya, ol’
Buddy ol’ pal!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Did the muds learn any fighting skills over recent years or any
years(it could help them)?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hey, just coz we’re a bunch of pushovers who’ll follow anyone
with a kind word or bottle of refreshing beverage, don’t mean we can’t
put up a struggle! You must notta been lookin’ when we were whippin’ out
our kickbutt weaponry and combat tactics. Whether we’re launching
assaults across the map with Storm Circles and Spooce Cannons, or
marching into battle with Elum cavalry and Meetle squadrons, you better
not underestimate us before trying to steal our lands and our people!
Plus, we can pack a mighty slap!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Since abe’s exodus starts as soon as abe farts at the end of
abe’s oddysee, why weren’t the games remade as one game?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Whoa, do you want us to release this thing any time soon or
not??
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What do Mudokons eat and drink?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Muddy me, what don’t we eat!? Well, we don’t eat each other, I
can tell ya that much. At least no one I know has ever admitted to
trying a Mudokon Pop. Oh hang on, SoulStorm Brew… Well, I guess we ain’t
actually so great after all. But it sure ain’t intentional, Scrabdangit!
When you find out what goes in that stuff, it kinda puts you off it, ya
know? Then again if that’s all it took we wouldn’t need a Rehab. I don’t
wanna think about this any more.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, how long can a mud live with out food or water? Also
how thirsty were you when you were in the desert with Abe? it was only a
day. could you have lived another two days?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Pally, I couldn’ta lived another minute! Don’t say ‘only a day’
like you’re regularly spending weeks at a time encased in salt. I’d like
to see you sweatin’ across the scorching wastelands of Necrum without so
much as a sandwich. Although we had plenty of sand so I guess all we’da
needed is a wich. Which reminds me, why didn’t we bring a shaman? Can’t
they cast rain spells and pull food outta thin air? I think I’m gonna
have to have some stern words with Big Face, that ivory tower coward.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How does one tame a paramite/scrab?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> NO, DON’T DO IT! There’s some knowledge that’s best left to the
protessionals, kiddo. I ain’t telling ya squat! You wanna go
predator-hunting in sacred stomping grounds, that’s your own death
sentence, and I ain’t lending you any hand or word of encouragement.
Trust me, punk, leave those beasts alone!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Speaking of love, do gender neutral Mudokons fall in love?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> With themselves? Sometimes. With SoulStorm Brew? Better believe
it. With each other? Eh. Not really the kinda thing we do. Not outta
choice, it’s just the way we’re built I guess. Sometimes Muds will form
strong bonds with one another and they’ll become pretty unseparable. But
that’s about trust and shared interests, and if my old Foster Slig
taught me anything, it’s that those things ain’t got two squashed Slurgs
to do with love. Now if you’ll excuse me, Buddy and I are gonna go knit
ourselves a new hackey sack.

Abe down in the eyes and not notice him, like then he puts one foot in a
shadow. Why are sligs so stupid and/or blind?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hey poo brain, you musta come to the wrong seminar! This is
the one meant to make us look good, not the one for your backwards
prejudices! Believe it or not, when a Mudokon hides in shadow they’re
actually in the dark, and I’m not a scientist but I know you need light
to see things! I dunno what brain virus makes Abe the dangerous renagade
he is, but it don’t make him glow in dark. Only ghosts do that! And ya
know what else ghosts are? Invisible! Maybe we ain’t the sharpest dice
in the deck, but you can’t hold ghosts against us!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What do sligs use their face tentacles for besides pulling
switches? Cheers Alf \#DearAlf

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> As little as possible. Seriously, the only reason we don’t tie
the things up in a bag is because it’s so uncomfortable. Half the reason
we try to save up for awesomer armor is that we get to cover up our ugly
faces even more, tentacles included. I don’t think you get how ugly we
are, and how much that holds us back in life. If you had tentacles
hanging off your face, you’d understand.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I saw a sligs face once. I turned around and farted in its
general direction, then ran the hell away. Do you know where i can see
therapy about not screaming at it

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Crig: You did the right thing, especially the part where you span
around and got away from the crime scene face first. Times like that you
gotta look after number one and protect yourself from further harm. I
mean, a true hero woulda dived at the offending mug with the nearest
available anything in a desperate bid to shield that dangerous
appearance from the rest of the world. Be traumatized for life, but
you’d save a lot of others from the same fate. But you ain’t a hero.
Best therapy about is always Alf. Stick about after this, he’ll help ya
out!

Alf: Oh no no no, you’re not unloading your horrible experience on
me! Sorry, but that’s a visual description I’m keepin’ faaaar away from.
Uhh, go talk to the Raisin.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> i know that sligs are always treating mudokons like slaves
but what do sligs eat and drink anyway?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hey now, don’t go saying spurious things like that. It’s the
Glukkons that treat Mudokons like slaves. Far as we’re concerned, you
guys are fellow workers to be harrowed and bullied and beaten like any
other. Don’t go thinking we’re the ones making the rules, we just enjoy
following them! What do we eat and drink? Same stuff you guys do: fast
food, junk food, snack food, brew and coffee. See, we ain’t so different
after all! I’m going home tonight to a feast of Momma Flabby’s homestyle
ready-dining! I love that Momma.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, you do you thinks is the stupidest Sligs or Glukkons?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> As someone who can answer this question a lot more objectively
than Alf, I can confirm that Glukkons are stupidest. I mean, we’ve got
pants and guns and Whack-a-Mud. They’ve got shareholder meetings,
shoulder pads and Need-a-Hand. What more do I need to say?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> \#DearAlf You haven’t come across any Albino Sligs recently
have you? I know they tend to disappear after birth, but thought I’d ask
anyways.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I haven’t come across any weird-lookin’ Sligs. Trust me, after
dishing out the healthy overdose of taunting and bludgeoning they have
coming to ’em, I’d remember! We have a reputation to maintain: We’re
ruthless, heartless security jerks, here to stomp on upstart slaves and
keep out self-righteous rebels. Every Slig has been through a
nightmarish selection process to ensure only the finest, fittest,
fightingest specimens make it to factory floors. There’s no room for
genetic setbacks or standout non-conformists. An albino Slig would be a
threat to the financial security of Sligdom and should be teased
mercilessly.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I heard of an earthling monster called “Cthulu”
which is like a giant (AND I MEAN GIANT) Slig that has wings, scales,
and is much, much worse.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Probably the result of some twisted Vykker experiment. The
things they can do with GM steroids and a tube of supposterone would
leave you speechless. Gonna assume you don’t mean mechanical wings, so
who knows where they come from. Probably a casual bit of limb-splicing
from a Flying Scrab. All in a day’s leisure time for them, and then it’s
time for their real work. They’re disturbing and frightening. I’ve
signed up for some of their experimental arm-regrownanism. Maybe I’ll
get a wing and be able to fly in circles.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> the slig in love?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Love? Where is that? I’ve never heard of a Slig from there.

Thanks, Crig! It’s thanks to your tireless campaign circuit that

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: \#DearAlf So Crig, who do these worthless Mudokens
worship? Probably some 7 armed cow that encourages people to fart. Death
to the mudokens!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Uhhh, Crig was here last week. Do you… are you in the right
place?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How do mudokons have the ability to chant? Are all mudokons born
with this ability or do they learn it?

Alex: Also can all Mudokons Chant like Abe? Thanks Alf your the
bestest.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sure, all Mudokons can chant, same way anyone can sing. Doesn’t
mean everyone’s equally good at it. I’ve met ancient Muds who trained
their whole life just to levitate a pebble using all their
concentration. Abe’s what you’d call a natural, the envy of shamans
everywhere.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> So Alf, I was wondering when Abe chants, what is he really
saying, is he speaking in some ancient language or is he just muttering
gibberish like he sounds he’s doing?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You know how Abe learnt to chant? We were doing a shift in a
high security Zulag and, not wanted to fall asleep on security cam
footage, our Slig supervisor wandered off to get a can of Zap. But with
no one around to beat us we got chattin’, complaining about the noise of
the heavy machinery. Abe thought it would be rad to do an impression of
the meat saws spinning—it was rubbish! But before we could boo him we
see all these sparks comin’ offa him! Next thing we know, big red arcs
of lightning fly into him and he’s knocked to the ground. What a freak!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey dear Alf How abe meditate so long……i try it with humans
like Kim jong il or Barack Obama….but my power is useless……please help
me alf to become a better peacefully earth.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Psychic powers come so naturally to Abe he couldn’t tell you
how to get better at it. Kinda like how I can’t tell you how I make such
great tea—it’s just something that happens! If you’re really interested
in commiting acts of mind control is go study under a shaman, practise
all day, get plenty of sleep, and drink’s Alf’s amazing tea. But be
careful, those guys probably have their own chant suppressors!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> \#DearAlf Has Abe ever possessed you?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Of course not! Abe respects the autonomy of all his friends too
much to ever think about doing that. He’s really the best like
thaaarRghHbluuUrghgGt! Scrabdangit, Abe, I told you to cut that out!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> This one’s very important….. How did Abe find out that he
can possess his fart? And what’s the whole technology behind it-is it
the spirits of the mudokons who’s bones are in the brew the ones he can
actually possess or what? :-)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Same way he figures out a lot of his powers: by looking at what
the Glukkons tell him not to do, then doing that. Once you spot that
pattern you see it all over the place. As for the science of possessing
farts, lemme ask ya this: What’s the science behind possessing anything
else, huh?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How come Abe is the only mudokon who, as Mr. Uncle V.P. Aslik
put it, can have “fun with farts” after drinking Soulstorm Brew? I mean,
it seems really unlikely that you and the other chumps sat in that part
of the Necrum mines for so long without any of you farting and blowing
each other up once, so it seems you didn’t have fun with farts. And as a
result, how did Uncle Aslik find out about fun with farts if regular
mudokons can’t do it (they just get sick) to write the tourist tips
about it in Feeco Depot?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oh trust me, it happens. Many valuable company assets are lost
to the dangerous gas that drink gives ya. Weighed against the “loyalty”
of the workers it pays off in Glukkons’ minds, but we have to be very
vigilant when we get new addicts in the Rehab. Who knows what they’ve
got bubbling inside ’em! We were lucky. In case ya didn’t notice, we’d
just walked across a desert. Our bodies were preserving fluids.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hey alf, since farting is abe’s gamespeak specialty, and burping
is Munch’s, what other bodily functions can we look forward to from the
coming saviors of oddworld?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Uhhhhhhhhhhh, sneezing. Yeah, great big gloopy nasal emissions.
Use it to sticky your enemies to the floor, slime your way up sheer
cliffs or swing across the ceiling with superstrong snotstrings like
everybody’s favorite superhero: Bolamite Mud. Featuring hitherto
unexplored sinus controller technology for that unique
can’t-quite-get-your-sneeze-to-come-out sensation. But hey, nobody
listens to my design ideas anyway, it’ll probably be crying or
something.

So with all this in mind, my liberatee chums, finish your teas, sweep up
your crumbs and go out into the big wide world safe in the knowledge
that maybe you too could one day be seizing control of your friends’
bodies or assuming the brief existence of explosive flatulence.

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Glukkons® walk on their hands which suggests to me that they either
have very little legs or no legs at all. This has led me to conclude
that if a Glukkon is by itself it has no way to defend itself, which
made me wonder: How could the Glukkons persuade the sligs and the slig
queen to work for them in the first place?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Moolah. Power. Pants. Take your pick.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How did Abe® come across his name? I'll guess that the Glukkons
wouldn't waste their "valuable" time naming their slaves, so who did?
Did the Mudokon Queen Sam name him at birth, and if so how did he
remember it?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Mudokons name each other. It's a lot less confusing that
saying, "Hey, you!" all the time.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Alf, are you an ex-RuptureFarms-slave saved by Abe or were you a
wild Mudokon who joined him on the quest for Necrum?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I wish I knew. Thanks to my SoulStorm® Brew addiction, I have
these ...uh ... blackouts. Sometimes I just forget what...uh forget ...
What was the question, again?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Speaking of names, do Sligs have names? If so, who names them? If
not, are they identified by numbers (like all the fan-fiction writers
seem to believe)?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yes, Sligs have names. They earn them in the cr?che, after
graduating from Slaughter School.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What are rats? What are Sea Rexes? What are Mudflubs?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Various Oddworld animals that you'll see in Munch's Oddysee and
other future games.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why do you torture us by not explaining anything clearly??

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> [www.springfield-il.com/kids/8ball/8\_ball](http://www.springfield-il.com/kids/8ball/8_ball.shtml)
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I wonder a thing about the movie or/and the picture when you see
Mudokons riding on some Elums, what are they doing? Are they hunting? If
they are hunting then what do they hunt? Mudokons have to eat
something!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Mudokons have used Elums for generations for all manner of
work: hunting, traveling, scouting. As far as what we hunt...well,
anything we can get!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will Munch be in a wheelchair throughout the whole game? If so then
how does he jump and what kind of view do you get, is it like Abe's
Exoddus?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Munch can get in and out of his chair. He's awkward on land, so
the chair helps him travel rapidly over flat surfaces.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why is Abe's mouth stitched up, all the other Mudukons' mouths
aren't?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Abe's lips were stitched up to keep him from chanting. It
didn't work, and Abe could have removed his stitches a long time ago,
but he keeps them as a reminder of what he once was, and what awaits us
all if he fails.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What does Bigface look like?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No one has ever seen him without his mask.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Who is the Mudokon named "Sam" and what connections does he have
with the Oddworld Quintology?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> "He" is a "she," and you'll find out in Munch's Oddysee.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Could the "aliens" that capture Munch when he is stuck in a bear
trap possibly be humans?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Not unless humans are using Vykkers technology.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will the "meeches" shown in the Abe's Exoddus starting fmv on a
poster labeled "extinct" ever resurface in a later game?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I wouldn't bet against it.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will the Big Bro Sligs be a tough enemy in Munch's Oddysee?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The toughest. We're talking armor, brawn, firepower, and a room
temperature IQ.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Does Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee have bosses? Will Munch and Abe
fight the Glukkon queen?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Queen Margaret would never sink so low.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will there be a game without Abe? Will there be a game that goes
back to when the Meeches were around?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> At one point "Hand of Odd®" was going to be set in Oddworld's
past, before Abe's birth ... and we might explore Oddworld's past some
time in the future. But right now, as in the past, we're concentrating
on the future. Past results, however, are no indication of future
performance. Consult your broker before investing in this or any other
fund.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, what're the chances of Abe's Oddysee and Exoddus being
re-released for Xbox? You know, all-on-one-disc-for-a-budget-price kinda
thing? Go on! Please?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The chances of seeing such a thing are extremely remote, as
platform differences between the Xbox and the original PlayStation are
so great that we'd pretty much have to re-do the games from scratch.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I would like to know how far the emotion engine goes in the means
of helping out hope-shattered slaves. I mean, will it be much more of a
caring, nurturing thing when you meet up with a beaten Mudokon, or, and
I mean these words, will it be more of a pat on the shoulder, a quick
"sorry," and "ok" response, then the Mudokon follows you? I hate to say
it, but the situations I described that appeared in Exoddus seemed
soul-less & empty. That's not really what happens, which made it kind of
unrealistic. Know what I mean?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, I know that Abe was the first guy that ever spared a kind
word for little ol' me. A little kindness goes a long way when you're a
slave, and I know a lot of the guys feel the same way.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey, Alf, in Munch's Oddysee will be able to control Mudokons with
Vykkers.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Vykkers can't control Mudokons. At least, I hope they can't.
Yipes!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Abe's Exoddus was Abe's Odyssee's bonus game. Will Hand of Odd be
Munch's Odyssee's bonus game or will there be a Munch's Exoddus?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No, Hand of Odd is an entirely separate concept. The bonus game
for Munch will be Munch's Exoddus.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Yo, did the Vykkers scientists saw their own feet off or something?
They have stitched up stumps.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Or something.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will we be seeing any appearances by any of the "extinct" races of
Oddworld, like some secrete secluded area where meeches still thrive?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oddworld is a big place, so you never know...
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I thought Scrabs were solitary creatures that hated each other; so
why are there cinematics on the site in which you see Scrabs in herds?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The Scrabs you saw in past games were "Alpha Scrabs"- rogue
males that can't stand the sight of other Alpha Scrabs. Long confinement
in stockyards and ancient temples had made them a bit cranky. In Munch's
Oddysee, you'll see Scrabs as they live in the wild with a single Alpha
Scrab at the head of a heard of lesser Scrabs. They're still pretty
cranky, though.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will there ever be Slig without its mask in Munch's Oddysee? Will
we ever see what they look like without a mask on?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Ugh! Why would you want to see such a thing?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi, Alf. Slurgs eat Fleech offal, right? Offal is not poop, so why
does everybody seem to act as if it is?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It's all the same when it's stuck to your shoe.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Are Glukkons and Sligs related biologically/evolutionary speaking?
What about Elums and interns?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You've got some strange notions, son!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Does the Almighty Raisin belong to a species?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No one knows. The Almighty Raisin is an enigma.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> If some Sligs are fairly wealthy, and some Glukkons are really
poor, then could a Slig buy a Glukkon slave?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> A Glukkon would sell his own heart before allowing such a
thing.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Did RuptureFarms make food out of Elums?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Some of the guys remember seeing a skinned Elum hanging around
the place, so, yeah, they probably did.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Who produces the punk rock the interns listen to?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Punk rockers.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How do greeters balance?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Pretty darn well, I'd say!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will there ever be a film about Oddworld?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Absolutely.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What's the average yearly rainfall in Oddworld?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> On average, the water falls down, and hits the ground.
Sometimes it goes up, but not so often.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What sports do free Mudokons play?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Me an' Buddy play hackey-sack every now and then.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Who was the fattest person and how heavy?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the heaviest
man of all time was the late Jon Brower Minnoch, who was just a Meech
Munchy shy of weighing 975 pounds.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Are you a virgin?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hold on a second...uh...ok...no, not anymore.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> After looking over the skull schematic of a Mudokon, I couldn't
help noticing that there appeared to be the Mudokon's long lost nostrils
at the top of its head. Alf, is that where your nostrils are located?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Are you a Vykker?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> The same skull picture showed the distinctive lack of teeth. I
believe it was said that Mudokons evolve from birds. Do Mudokons have a
beak behind their lips? Is their jaw strength stronger or weaker due to
this feature? Could a Mudokon potentially bite someone and actually be
effective?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You ARE a Vykker!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How do Glukkons sleep? Do they rest on their forearms, sleep
standing up, or lay down on couch/hammock/bed/etc.?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Give me back my skull, and we'll talk.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Abe is 15, and Munch is 18. How old are they in human years?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I dunno. What's a "human?"
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Glukkons have small eyes, which are very sensitive to the light,
does this mean you can blind them by smashing windows to make sunlight
come through?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I've never tried it. Glukkons do seem to like gloomy places,
but that might just be their nature.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will you be able to talk to Interns and help Interns get what they
want from life?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You can talk to Interns, but they can't hear you over that
infernal racket coming from their headphones.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I heard that you will be able to make the profit makers of the game
bankrupt by stealing their credit cards, is this be true?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I'll have to try that the next time our publishers visit the
office.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> When the Quintology is over on Oddworld, will you be going to a
different world?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No one's mentioned anything to me. Do you think I should pack a
bag?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How many endings will they be to Munch's Oddysee, please make at
least four endings!!!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I'd like to see a dozen, just so long as they're all happy
endings.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How many endings were there in Abe's Exoddus, I got the bad ending
and the good but if you saved all 300 do you get a third?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There's a little bonus recognition for being perfect.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is the Oddworld team still going to include lethal weaponry or only
non-lethal like the Blitz-Packer??

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yes!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Since there's money involved in Munch's Oddysee, will you be able
to buy stuff, like clothes?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> What's "money?" Is it anything like Moolah?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> was reading in a book and came across a section that explained the
color and meaning of auras. The text reads: "A stong presence of red
indicates a willfull personality; it may signify selfishness, physical
strength, or powers of leadership. Green is the color of nature and
healing, but may reveal a deceitful character. Orange is an indicator of
physical health. A strong yellow presence reveals intellectual
abilities. Blue refers to one's religious or spiritual state: the deeper
the blue, the more enlightened the individual. Black is the color of
death, malice, or evil. And gray indicates a depressed or melancholy
personality." -From 'Facts and Fallacies' by Reader's Digest. This made
me wonder about the color of Mudokons. Was this the inspiration for
their colors? Blue, green (and I think I've seen orange somewhere, but I
could be wrong!). Thank you for your time.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Uh ... I dunno about auras, and all that. We're just the colors
that we are. Some of the guys have auras after drinking too much
SoulStorm® Brew, but I think that's something different.

The End...whew!

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Dear Alf, quick question. If you were stuck in some evil
factory again with tons of bad guys between you and freedom who would
you choose to help you get out? Your options are Abe, Munch, or
Stranger.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yeah, I’d definitely choose those guys! Between them there’s
probably nothing they couldn’t infiltrate, sabbotage or liberate. Nice
options!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How is Munch doing after his vykers labs adventure?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well you know, he needed a bit of a break after that whole
ordeal, so on the Raisin’s advice he went for a nice, relaxing skiing
vacation. Munch looks so adorable in a scarf!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Can you tell me more about Soots(Dear Alf 47) what is he is like
when relaxing and could we see more of his breakdance moves?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Soots is a great dancer all round, not just breakdance. He
honed his skills of balance and rhythm carrying timed bonepowder kegs in
Bonewerkz. When Abe rescued him he developed an interest in tribal
dance, but it wasn’t long before he was establishing his own unique
style. He says next year he’s going on sabbatical to learn the dances of
other natives Mudoswide.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Oddworld Inhabitants, I want a confession…..how much
misspellings of the word “Mudokon” have you seen?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> More than the number of SpooceShrubs I’ve seen.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> So, i heard from Crig that there are.. erm.. flying scrabs.
how does that even work and WHY WOULD someone UNLEASH SUCH A MONSTROSITY
UPON ODD?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> A FLYING SCRAB?? Are you sure??? I mean, you did hear it from a
Slig. Not being funny, but they’re not exactly known for their reliable
information, unlike your ol’ pal Alf. Have you ever seen Magog On the
March? And Crig is an old tabloid columnist, he knows how to pull your
leg… professionally!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was wondering, is Abe’s gender neutral or male? I’ve
read they’re gender neutral/sexless but I keep seeing sources referring
to their gender as he. Is he seen the same way as they in Oddworld or is
Abe transgender and identifies as male regardless of them lacking drone
bits?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Like every other Mudokon you’ve seen, Abe and me and Buddy and
Soots, we’re biologically asexual. There are male Mudokons (Drones) and
female Mudokons (Queens) but we’re neither of them. We use the pronoun
‘he’ because, well, pretty much just because. It’s worth remembering
that we’re products of a ‘Civilized’ world that encourages us to
slaughter wildlife and topple ecosystems without sparing a thought for
the victims. We destroy instead of nurture, a traditional diagnosis of
masculinity by your world’s standards. The same is especially true for
bullyish Sligs and capitalist Glukkons, even if our leaders are Queens.
Who wants to hire a friendly, considerate security guard??
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 1 why is abe and the sling shot mud blue is it that they are
breeders or some thing like that?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Nah, the Muds who breed Elums and Meetles are different guys.
Could be any reason the guards are blue. Remember we change color when
we’re emotional, and body paint is a huge part of our culture.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2 and why doses the sling shot one hit abe?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Because it’s designed to protect Monsaic Lines, the Mudokons’
most holiest of holy caves, preserving millennia of ancient Mudokon
rockart, sculpture and other religious relics, from any intruders that
might damage them or hurt the safety or serenity of such a safe haven.
Don’t you think they did a good job!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 3 a side thing why don’t you use character art ? like this ^.^

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> €8\~

Alf will be back with another assortment of your fan creations next week
with the final FArT of the year, but Big Face is predicting heavy
weather soon after that, so we’re advising all you Rehabitants to stay
home and take care instead of trekking out to Alf’s.

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: dear Alf what company did lulu work for before he opened lulu
fund?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Lulu worked for Flub Fuels, staffing a tiny filling station out
in the middle of noplace. You wouldn’t believe how bad he was at it. I
heard one time his boss came in to find him with his feet up reading a
juicy gossip magazine, except this one time was every single day! No
wonder nobody got suspicious when Abe and Munch were making him super
rich for no reason.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> what is the life spawn of a mudokon and a glukkon?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Mudokons aren’t spawned live, we hatch from eggs. Pretty big
eggs, too! One of those things could feed a family of twelve for a
couple of days! Not that you’d ever do that, of course. Glukkons might
be born live, but they’re morally dead, so it doesn’t matter.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How old can Glukkons get? Or does they live forever?
Because i mean, you can see how old a human is but not at a Glukkon :)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Glukkons are pretty hardy and get can just. Keep. On. Going.
For the better part of a century if they aren’t blown to chunks by
glowing ghostly sparkles, a renegade Slig’s bulletspray or the
occasional factory obliteration. They certainly don’t live forever. In
fact, by the standards of a lot of other Oddworld species, those 80-odd
years make for a pretty flash-in-the-pan existence. I guess you have
trouble telling how old a Glukkon is because you’re just not used to
them. If you lived your whole life in Glukkon society you’d not think
twice about it, which is coincidentally similar to how you’d feel about
steamrolling villages.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What did Meeches look like? can you draw a picture of one?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> From personal experience I can tell you that they were
horrible, horrible, ugly and horrific things to behold. They were
rubbery and fleshy and they oozed a horrible red pus. They used to fly
through the air on metal hooks, sometimes dropping down on us poor,
unsuspecting workers. It was all very disturbing. Then they’d cocoon
themselves in wooden barrels, and when they emerged again they’d
transformed into delicious Meech Munchies. It was all worth it in the
end. I’m afraid I can’t draw one because I had to eat all my crayons
while I was trapped in the storeroom.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, how come all we ever see Abe wearing is his loincloth?
Abe never even changes his loincloth once in the entire Abe’s Oddysee
game, and that’s a long game! I mean, he’s got to change some time
right? He can’t just be wearing the same unclean loincloth all day
right?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> And why not? You think we got wardrobes of clean clothes in
RuptureFarms? Pah, you kids today with your limitless sunglasses and
more than one sock, you’re barely aware you’re hatched! Why, I’d have
given my left arm for a dirty rag to wipe the excess Elum-hoof grease
out of the chutes of clogged vendos, but when all you have is a
loincloth you’d better be prepared to use that instead. Doesn’t matter
if you’ve been toiling in the swelter of the furnace room or wading
armpit-deep in Paramite plop, that loincloth is the one thing standing
between you and savage indecency, so you stick with it! And frequently
to it! Sheesh, ya buncha neat freak whinebabies.

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Finally are any ideas being thrown around between you’re
friends at Oddworld Inhabitants for new games?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You’d better believe it! We recently announced at the Austrian
“Baiting Imagination” Gaming Convention (ABIGCON) that we have already
started work on a brand new title called Oddworld: Alf’s Concoction.
It’s kind of an online fabrication simulator where you have to make up
as much stuff as possible. The more ridiculous, the better, but at the
end of it you get to see how many silly consumers bought it all! I’ve
been having so much fun playing it!

On that exciting revelation, we’re going to let Alf go home and relax
properly for a bit. But not for long! Because of course, now that we’re
back to all of our regularly-scheduled Oddcasts, next week sees the
first Fan Art Tuesday of 2014.

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Have you ever thought of stealing sligs pants and using
them for transport or for decoration?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They’re made for Sligs! Sligs don’t have legs!! Do ya expect us
to teeter on top of ’em? Where would we stick the tubes?? And I’ve no
idea how you think phat-fueled robot limbs might be considered
decorative. Maybe we’d unscrew the kneecaps and hang them on the wall
like miniature shields. Or turn ’em upside down and use the legs like a
coat stand. Whaddya reckon? Oh wait, we don’t wear coats.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> When the swinging rocks screenshot from NnT got released, it
showed that the rocks aren’t really moving by anybody above them, they
are just tied to the ‘roof’… How is that possible that they swing
indefinitely, then?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Maybe you can’t see it from all the way down there, but if I
give you a leg up and you clamber up there, shortly before a starving
bat knaws your ears off you’ll see they’re hooked up to a complicated
assembly of ropes, axles and pulleys that are constantly swinging the
boulders. What’s powering the ropes? Beats me! They go off in loadsa
directions and into tiny holes, but if it’s like typical ancient Mudokon
technology it’s powered by the flow of wind, water or spiritual energy.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How could all those slogs fit in a tiny slog hut.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There ain’t a single labor law covering ’employment’ of
Mudokons out here. What makes ya think there are laws about how many
mutts you can cram in a tight space? In fact, what a great way to make
them pathologically cranky!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Finally do breath oxygen or is it another element.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> This is a great question! Hang on, let me look at the air
closely under this magnifying glass. Hmm. Is that smudge an oxygen? It
looks horrible. I certainly hope I ain’t breathing that in, ewww.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Let me ask you something: As I went back in time with my special
ability and watched Abe rescue all mudokons for the X-th time during his
“Exoddus” I noticed the “Workers in Brewery” countdown at the SoulStorm™
Brewery never goes down but stays at 90. What did your keyboard pressin’
gods of game development mess up there?? It’s in all versions I played
so far (PS1, PC, PS3)! And where’s the patch for that bug in this
awesome game? ;)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The Magog Sign Company never thought it would be needed. Put it
this way: when you’ve got nearly a hundred workers, you might expect a
couple to escape. It’s important to know that, so you can recapture or
replace them. But you’ve still got nearly a hundred workers! No biggie
if that number doesn’t change. If you’re asking if the Glukkons were
woefully underprepared for Abe coming up and freeing every last one of
them, then the answer is yes! I only hope they don’t go too far now they
know what a single Mudokon can be capable of.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Have you ever had a run in with a snoozer?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> If you mean Snoozer as in the giant, three-legged robotic
nursemaid with tranquilizer turrets, then no. If you mean Snoozer as in
one the lazier managers we had back at the Farms, then yes. To cut a
long story short, he woke up.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> what do the industrialists use snoozers for? its not like there are
plenty of sligs out there.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They’re tough and automated combination lab assistants and
crowd control to take care of any loose specimens that pose a threat to
staff safety. The Vykkers made them to curb Intern injuries. Trust those
paranoid industrial creeps to take what should be a safety measure and
use it as an offensive mobile weapon. And yeah, there are plenty of
Sligs, but they’re small and squishy, and every one lost means paying
damages to Skillya.

Looking at your throbbing brains, you’ve all been learning far too much.

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: I was sitting down with my own cup of tea reading the latest
issue of “Dear Alf,” when I noticed nearly (if not all) the questions
were either about Abe, or even directly to him! Now don’t get me wrong
friend, Abe is a good guy and all, but this is your article Alf! So my
question is, why did everyone have an Abe hype suddenly?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Abe’s a pretty popular guy, and can ya blame him? He rescued a
whole buncha Mudokons from a life of slavery, including yours truly. No
surprise he gets a lotta fan mail, and it’s my job to answer it all!
Capisce? Well, I ain’t seen that guy about much lately, so sure. I’m
gonna make this an Abe-free week here at Dear Alf Headquarters (aka
Alf’s Rehab & Tea).
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How do you make time between reading fan mail and making tea?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It’s a gruelling regime that often has me up aaaall night
trying to cram it all in. Sometimes I resort to reading fan mail while
making tea. Sometimes that gets messy. Like this one time I poured
teabags all over myself! But I was lucky, I know Muds who’ve been
through worse. One of my assistants (hey, I gotta sleep too) wasn’t
paying attenion one time when she was juggling tea-making with
organizing the weekly hackey-sack tournament, and she poured sugar all
over her feet! Let this be a warning: pay attention to what you’re doing
in the kitchen! I don’t ever want my ingredients wasted again.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How strong are your arms? Like ranging from 1
(Master tea stirrer) to 423 (I can punch a scrab to death)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I am a master tea stirrer (I’m a master tea everything), so I
guess 1.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I had a dream where you and i destroyed rupture farms
and saved abe. It was awesome! i was wondering if i could be a mudokon ,
should i be a native, tomahawker , or a mudarcher?  
p.s  
i’m drinking tea right now XD

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Tea-riffic! Dreams can be powerful and incisive, but yours just
sounds cool! It makes sense that you and I would save Abe. How could he
even chant to open bird portals with those silly stitches in his lips?
Eh, whatever, I said I wasn’t gonna talk about that guy. You should
totally be a tomahawker. Mostly because I don’t want you drifting into
your dreamland while firing a Spooce Bow.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What was it like in Rupture Farms? Any actual “perks” of
working there? Were you even allowed to talk to your fellow mudokons
when the sligs weren’t around?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> We got free food and shelter. I mean we had to do our jobs, but
at the end of the day everything we needed was provided to us.
Everything we thought we needed, I should say. We could talk a bit at
work, depending on what the job was and who was supervising, but not
much, and it was monitored closely to make sure we were loyal and
subserviant to the company. On the plus side, we were sometimes allowed
to use a cloth to scrub the floor.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Also could you name a creature that we haven’t heard about
yet?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sure! Gimme a list of all the creatures you’ve heard about and
I’ll add another one to it.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What is a chronicler and are they related to interns it
anyway?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Chroniclers are highly intelligent and massive suckups; Interns
are vacant-minded and barely motivatable. I don’t think they’re related.
Great Chroniclers are lawyars and accountants, able to spot any loophole
that will benefit their paymaster. They also make good middle managers
because they naturally strive for efficiency and productivity. It’s a
foolish family that shirks their services.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will we be seeing you go on your own Tea filled adventure?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I’m struggling to decide what to do next. I could accept that
semi-starring role in SpooceShrubs vs Mudombies, or I coud take a risk
and be a bit more adventurous, trying to take down the local branches of
that coffeehouse chain everybody’s always going on about. Abe keeps
offering to do it for me, but I just tell him no! I can do this! Why
don’t you believe in me? Eh, whatever, I’m going to bed.

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: how dose the magog cartel take over muddoken villages exactly?
do you just surrender when they come to capture you or do you logically
fight or try to escape form them?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Since Abe started spreading the word and teaching everyone what
’employment’ really means, they’ve started using more force—Gee,
thanks Abe! Historically, when we weren’t so scattered and weak, they
used more devious tactics, like you’ve seen in Abe’s Exoddus. Addiction
leading to dependence on them for supply. But they still do this today.
In the future we’ll find out more about the history between Mudokons and
Glukkons.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> why do civilizations of oddworld hate your kind so much, don’t
you think you and your peeps should fight for your right?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oh humsh, I dunno why they hate us. We never did anything bad!
Maybe we’re just easy pickings and they’re all a pack of jerks. And it
ain’t like we ain’t trying to fight back! We’re sieging their factories
and trying to raise awareness on the FUD Network. But we don’t have
weapons factories and private militaries on our side. Alls we gots is a
chump in a loincloth.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> will abe ever be able to ride a scrab into open battle against
the glukkons? elum is pretty cool, but c’mon, scrabs man.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> On the one hand, you gotta be pretty reckless to think anybody
could ride a Scrab. I mean, sure, I have actually seen it done. But the
discipline it takes, the years of training, the countless near-death
accidents… Abe’s barely got the patience to comb his ponytail, I don’t
think he’ll ever give up the ease of an Elum. I say ease. I mean
compared with Scrabs, which have historically been noted to treat him
with far more murdersome aggression. On the other hand Scrabman is a
cool name for a superhero!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> If a human came to oddworld how would a mudokon react, would
mudokonse kill a human on site? or would they be allies?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hey, what kind of barbarians do you take us for? You’ve been
buying into all that Glukkon propaganda, haven’t you! Next you’ll be
calling us cannibals or accusing us of casting hexes on your withered
crops. Truth is, we don’t actually kill anyone on sight if it’s not
outright combat. In fact, why don’t you head on over to Alf’s right now?
I’ve got a delicious pot of blabweed tea on the boil.

<p><b>Alf:</b> Mad?? I’m absolutely steaming! Haha, only joking, that’s
actually the steam coming from the kettles. I put them there ealier so
it would look like steam was coming from my ears when I got to this

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: alf, what’s the BIOLOGICAL diversity on mudos? like, the
variety of creatures, how many, etc? (On earth,for example there are
like 900 thousands known living insects which would be about 80 percent
of all living things, while around 99 percent of all of our everything
is extinct)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oddworld’s a pretty big place. I’ve done a lot of traveling,
but I ain’t got the Moolah for intercontinental flights or access to the
Vykkers’ Bestiaryboxx. I can’t give ya numbers, but I can give ya rules!
As a rule, the meek outnumber the powerful. It might look like there’s a
whole lotta Sligs between you and that Bird Portal, but rummage around
in the undergrowth and count the Fuzzles or Rats. Assuming you don’t get
shot, you’ll probably lose count. Now kick it down a notch and count the
Bolamites or the Slurgs. I ain’t even got lenses to see smaller than
that, but you’d better believe there’s bigger worlds down there.
Interestingly, the same holds true for Mudokon slaves versus powerful
industrialists. It takes a lot of Mudokons to operate a factory that
maybe only a single Gluk runs. It makes ya wonder what would happen if
those kinds of numbers started standing up against the superior
firepower.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> It seems that a lot of creatures from Odd are similar, highly evolved
versions of creatures from Earth. Stunks are like skunks, Fleeches are
like leeches that can attack from afar, and Bees are, well, bees.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Whadaya mean, ‘highly evolved’? Our creatures have their own
evolutionary history that’s totally independent of everything you’ve got
going on down there. Well, maybe not totally independent. They’ve got
much the same threats and dilemmas to be working against: shortage of
food, shortage of physical support, shortage of not getting eaten. Some
shapes and adaptations just make sense, y’know? I’m pretty sure you’ve
got animals that shoot their tongue out to catch things, even if your
equivalent ain’t a two-headed sharp-toothed worm.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I have a question, in Abe’s Odyssey, when he was given power by
the ancients, did that change his physical appearance, im speaking
muscular wise, the other mudokons (spelled wrong, but whatevz)are all
bony, but he is ripped…sorta

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Ha ha ha! Abe! “Ripped”! You crack me up. Seriously now, Abe’s
about as skinny as they come outside of starvation. When the rest of us
were carrying heavy loads and doing a hard day’s work in RuptureFarms,
that high-celled patsy was nudging machines along the floor. And now
we’re bustin’ our butts building villages, hefting tomahawks and hunting
food, and he doesn’t so much as lift a finger to help with the bonfires.
Gimma a break. The only ripping Abe does comes from his behind.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, another question for you about the wildlife of oddworld.
How do the reproductive cycles of the various species on oddworld work?
are Scrabs HErmaphrodites? do paramites have queens? do fleeches even
reproduce? what about slogs, do they have a queen or are they born as a
mix of males and females? (Without the use of a queen)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Most of the creatures you’ve seen so far belong to
superspecies: tiny numbers of reproducing males and females, lots of
members of other “castes”. In Stranger’s Wrath you started seeing
species more familiar to you, with mostly even splits of two sexes as
far as we can tell. There are far more reproductive models that you’ll
learn about as we introduce new species. Paramites have Queens, they sit
ginormously in the nests. Female Scrabs form herds with the leader being
the ‘Queen’, while the males are expelled and left to fend for
themselves. Who knows where Slogs come from, if they have a Queen she’ll
be locked away and forced to produce large numbers of disposable
offspring. Fleeches I don’t even wanna think about.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I’m also curious about the Slogs: where did they came from? I
know that they are killing machines, but are they used to be tame and
nice creatures before they got to the Sligs?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I’ve heard some of the eldest shamans talk about Slogs like
they could be tender, loving lifelong companions. I’ve also heard them
talk about how tasty boiled grodwort is, so they’re clearly not to be
trusted.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> and finally there are humans in oddworld?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I sure hope not! Oddworld’s got enough problems already.

Wait, why are you leaving my Rehab? Hey, come back! I didn’t mean it
like that! Fine, see if I care! You’re… you’re coming back next week,
right? For Fan Art Tuesday?

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: dear alf i wanted to know this qutie a time now are there other
gods except for shrykull? lke glukons deities or somthing??

There is any other gods besides Shrykull?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Depends who you ask. Ain’t no shortage of different faiths on
Oddworld! You got your theistic ones, but talk to us Mudokons or the
Grubbs and you’ll find we’re more interested in the spirit world that
intersects our own. Everything’s got its own spirit if ya know how to
see it (a loada Spooce never won’t help): the creatures, the plants, the
rivers and mountains. Gods like Shrykull are more like aspects of this
than they are individuals sitting in the clouds. The Glukkons don’t
worship gods or spirits, they worship Moolah… at least these days.

</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What exactly is Big Face’s role and how did he get that
position in the first place? \#DearAlf

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Big Face is a spritual leader who sits about in Monsaic Lines
preserving all the ancient gubbins our ancestors left lying about the
place. He’s obsessed with the stuff. Odd knows what any of it prattles
on about, but he sure is quick to give Abe a helping handscar or two. Oh
sure, we’re all very grateful! But he only got the job by carving a
silly mask, so it clearly doesn’t take much. No wonder Abe went to the
Raisin.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> We know of 2 mudokon tribes so far, 1 for paramites and 1
for scrabs. Are there any other tribes that use/used other wild
creatures for their symbol? who are they, what are the creatures and can
you please describe them?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yeah sure, it’s not just wild creatures but there’s the
Mudmeechees, the Mudfleechees, the Mudofartees, the Mudteas, and my
favourite, the Mudalfas. I’m sure you can figure out what they all
worship. Oh, and the Mudunnoreelees.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hey Alf, do you believe that all glukkons including their
customers of industrial food products to be Pure Evil?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Y’know, ‘evil’ is such a broad term. There ain’t some pervasive
force o’ malevolence telling ’em what to do. They just don’t care about
who they step on to achieve their goals, because everyone’s done such a
great job of making them think that. But if we can stand up for
ourselves and make ourselves heard, they’ll learn they have to pay us
the respect we deserve.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, I hope this doesn’t sound racist but… Are you Mudokons
animals or People?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> At the risk of sounding like a bookend, it… depends who you
ask. Obviously we’re ‘people’ with family and culture and hopes and
dreams and faith and technology. We’re not just crawling about like
critters wanting for nothing more than food and safety… well, not most
days, anyway. But ask anyone raised in the Civilized parts of Mudos and
they’ll think we’re exactly that kind of knuckle-dragging barbarian.
It’s a lot easier to buy that latest Opple Fone when you’re told the
slaves that stitched it together aren’t people, after all.
Scientifically we’re animals because we evolved from other animals, but
ask a Mudokon Shaman and they’ll tell you we’ve actually lost something
in the process: that deep, natural connection to the spirit world. We
revere other animals for their connection, and study them that we might
learn to be so spiritual. At least, that’s what Big Face says.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Errr, uhhhh, ummm. One question in and I’m already sweatin’ it!
I guess… the answer… is yes? I mean, don’t forget that all the Muds
you’ve seen so far are worker-class: that means they’re not the ones
doing all the breeding, and in fact couldn’t if they wanted. That
stuff’s left to the queens and drones. Now you might find a pair o’ Muds

just a form of friendship. If you’re talking breeders, there’s one queen

<p><b>Question:</b> \#DearAlf When did you first find love Alf?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> When I was with Abe in the desert. The cooldown came soon after
and lingered sorely.

</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is there a Mrs. Alf? \#DearAlf

<p><b>Alf:</b> If there is, she ain’t taking my first name.

<p><b>Question:</b> do you love me? \#DearAlf

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You’re an Oddworld fan. Of course I love ya! You guys have
given us all we have, made us everything we are today. We owe it all to
you, and we’ll never, ever forget that. Happy Valentine’s, from our
Inhabitants to yours!

THAT’S ENOUGH LOVE! Please evacuate the Rehab to allow Alf a recover
from this overwhelming experience. If you get out in a hurry, he might
recover just in time to FArT.

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: dear alf everyone knows you’re the question guy on oddworld,
any oddworld related questions you have an answer for. I was wondering
what was the strangest question you have ever been asked during your
time?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> That’s me, the Question Guy! Also known as the Answer Chump,
the Reply Pal and the Information Master. All these job titles are
listed on my business teabag. Here, take a few and pass them to your
friends. The strangest question I’ve ever been asked is what I use to
wash my ponytail. I’ll never get over quite how creepy that was!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> and the dumbest question you have been asked? I was wondering if they
are around on your blog where can I find them?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Look, I ain’t one to point fingers, you! I’m not gonna turn our
beautiful community of amazing fans into a hunt for what you find
laughable! There’s no stupid questions in the sanctuary of Alf’s Rehab &
Tea. Now go and think about what you’ve done, afore I throw cookies at
ya!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, how ya doing? I was just wondering, if you or a
fellow Mudokon ever came across a human being, how would you react? I
guess you could get Abe to fart them away and never return, but i’m sure
you’d be nice, right?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You guys don’t like farts? Eep, I gotta go tell Abe this. He’s
got an important meeting at the Human Embassy right steefin’ now! Oh no.
Oh no, this is not good.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> \#DearAlf is there a three legged odd creature? With one big
back leg and two small front legs?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yeah, a Vykker.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Crig and Alf, where do Glukkon clothes come from, did the
Glukkons make those clothes themselves?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yeah sure, I can just see a Glukkon daintily sewing up an
outfit of its own design, dextrously threading the needle and putting on
all the buttons with unrivalled hand-eye coordi- wait, what-eye
coordination?? Come on now. Most Glukkon clothes are stitched together
by slaves in a factory – have you really not figured out this is how
everything’s made yet? Some of the very richest Glukks might be able to
afford the height of fashion custom made for ’em, though. But what
self-respecting CEO doesn’t want their outfit made from the blood, sweat
and bones of a savagely oppressed native nation?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> \#DearAlf Sorry Alf, someone hacked my account. Here’s my
real question; What’s with Abe pretending he’s at Rupture Farms again?
Is he crazy?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Quite possibly, but that’s got nothing to do with it. It’s all
about stories! Abe hasn’t really gone back to RuptureFarms… at least not
yet. We’re retelling the story of Abe’s escape from the company
retirement plan, like storytellers of old would entertain their audience
around the campfire with tales they’d heard before. The details would
change over time, but the story stays the same. And now we’re using the
latest technology, like the latest edition of a book would take
advantage of improvements to printing technology. So don’t worry, you’re
not caught in a time loop, Molluck has reopened the factory, and Abe’s
not that feeble of mind. Probably.

Hey, in case I didn’t make it obvious enough, I ain’t lost any of your
questions, OK? Everything you’ve sent me is sitting safely waiting for
that perfect weekly theme, the most appropriate news to coordinate with,
its own unique chance to shine like nothing else!

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: How many cups of tea do you go through? I mean, c’mon,
I’m sure it takes easily close to a thousand for a “Rehab and Tea”
session, right?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Depends who shows up. There’s a lotta souls to cleanse, and
they all gotta come through my door. Not that I have a door, it’s more
of a tarp. Anyway, we’ve got some industrial-scale consumers coming out
of the factories, y’know, a lifetime of addiction to work through. And
numbers keep going up as more and more folks hear about Abe and want
their slice of quarma quiche. If we hit a thousand cups a session I’m
gonna need to move to a bigger teahouse. Or start a chain. Anyone wanna
run a franchise?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How many times have you been killed or led to your
untimely death by Abe in Abe’s Exoddus?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Whaddaya yappin’ ’bout? You the prophet inspector now? Abe’s
never let me down. ‘Cept maybe that time he said he’d help me carry
leaves from the forest, and then Elum got bored and ran off with Abe on
him and I had to carry all the berries by myself. And even that was only
slightly his fault! The real question I want answered is: How many times
have YOU led me to my death? Don’t think I can’t see ya out there,
giggling at every bullet spray like a kid in a fart factory. Sickening.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> \#DearAlf What’s with that schmuck Abe’s ponytail? He can
possess a scrab with it short. Mine’s down to my knees and I can’t move
a fly! Bah

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You’re doing it wrong, chump. Your feathers are supposed to
grow as your spiritual wisdom and proficiency develop, not the other way
around. You can’t just stop going to the barber and expect new skills to
appear in your portfolio, you massive scrub. How ’bout you buck up your
game and actually try possessing something you could wrap your head
around, like a sloth or a lazy cat? Or perhaps a whiney grass.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf I heard that Oddworld is 7 times more large the earth,is
true?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sounds a bit excessive, if ya ask me. How does the gravity of
that make any sense? Seven times as much surface land to play around
with, maybe. But not seven times the size. You wouldn’t believe how many
scientists you upset when you go around saying nonsense like that!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What or who is the “Magog Cartel” named after?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You never heard of Magog before? Really, you kids are getting
cheated on your education, you really should register a complaint! This
name is many centuries old, and as I’m sure you know, history that
sticks around that long is likely to take part in the future at some
point.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> \#Dearalf ‘i’ve always wondered do flying big bro sligs exist?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> By the stains in my pot, there’d better not be! We get enough
trouble from the little ones buzzin’ about, droppin’ bombs for laughs.
Dang flyberks. Strap one of them wrecking bulls to a flying harness and
you’re in for some critical aerial demolition. But I think we’re safe –
I mean, can imagine the size of the balloon they’d need to keep him
floating?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, I heard Crig lost his arm – how did he lose it?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> He told me he trapped it in a slot machine he was trying to
reach inside.

So now the biggest mysteries of space have been solved by yours tealy
and you’re reeling from the shocking truths… you’d better have some good

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: So, Sligs go to Slaughter School. I'll assume Glukkons and Vykkers
go somewhere to get an education, yes?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Glukkons take a lot of correspondence courses, and I think
Vykkers learn about science by sending away for chemistry sets
advertised in the backs of old comic books. Or maybe they have sprawling
universities and business schools. I can't really say. I've never been
inside a Glukkon city to take a peek.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Haven't any of the Mudokons taken time to get to know a Slig? You
never know, Sligs could be warm on the inside and have a bitter outside
because of their BS with Molluck. Besides, isn't what you Mudokons are
doing called "racism?"

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Probably more like "species-ism." The only Sligs I've gotten to
know very well were the slugs that kept hitting me with gun butts, but
you're right, maybe they're decent guys under all that psychopathic
bravado. It's not their fault that they have to shoot guys in the back.
Yeah, I blame society.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey, you told me that in Munch's Oddysee Abe and Munch can take
more than one shot from a Slig's rifle. This seems like a good idea, but
I wanted to make sure that you were keeping it realistic. In MO will Abe
and Munch be able to keep walking after being shot seven times like in
many FPS games available on the market?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> We're still tuning the damage values of our characters. We're
aiming for a sweet spot between "bang, you're dead" and "bullets bounce
like tennis balls." Whatever we select, it will fit into the whole like
any other Oddworld mechanic.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What would one have to do to get an oddworld.com e-mail address?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Get a job with Oddworld Inhabitants.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> On the Oddworld site, they say Molluck the Glukkon is seeking his
way to the top again . . . but I thought he was dead in the end of Abe's
Oddysee?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You can't keep a good Glukkon down!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Can Abe Swim?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I dunno. Is flailing your arms around and screaming real loud
considered "swimming?"
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> As far as the Mudos know, possession is 9/10ths of the law. In
Munch's Oddysee will we be able to possess anything with a brain, like
all of the funky temple guards & what-have-you, or will there be
restrictions on some of them, like mental shielding?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> As in past games, there will be some things you can possess,
and some things that you can't. The criteria for what you can possess
has a lot to do with the intellect of the target. There has to be some
minimum degree of intelligence in anything you possess.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> In Abe's Exoddus, why doesn't Abe have the tattoos on his hands?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The stickers must have washed off in the bath.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How many different types of weapons will there be in Munch's
Oddysee?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I'm not sure what the official count is, right now, but there
will be plenty, and all of them hurt. The bad guys have their usual
assortment of guns, and the heavy armament packed by Big Bro Sligs
really stings. The good guys get some help this time around, in the form
of unique Spooce Weapons: bows, tomahawks, and more. Don't worry –
you'll have every chance to blast anything that moves, if that's what
floats your boat.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is Abe dating anyone? Are you dating anyone? Do you consider
yourself a chick magnet like Elum?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Aw, shucks. You're making my ears turn red!?
</p>
</div>

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: has abe or you or any other of your fellow mudokon
friends ever tought about going on an adventure with abe to save sam
(your queen)?, or do you think something’s gonna happen , like , the
spirits warning abe about a female mudokon about to be hatched and you
guys gathering an army/infiltrating the place she’s being held in to
save the egg or the already hatched female?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I don’t know what yur yappin’ about, master. If we spent Abe’s
Oddysee bringing down a stream of righteous lightning onto the pointy
head of our boss at work (spoilers for New ‘n’ Tasty, by the way), what
makes you think we’re gonna go out and do a kindness to some royalty
we’ve never heard of? Mudokon leaders are chosen for their spirituality,
not their bloodline, sheesh.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf! I wanna ask, I read somewhere that
modokons don’t usually get names from birth, and that they get their
names by other Modokons giving them one based on something unique or
something that stands out about the person they name, so I just
wondered, how did you and Abe get your names?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> When I were a nipper, butt-scootin’ way round the
slaughterhalls from job to job, I used to be really lazy. The other kids
always got angry at me, saying I was ‘alf-assed. I guess it stuck.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi again Alf! I was just wondering, since you and Abe are
brothers, you wouldn’t happen to know which one of you is the older
one?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Not really. No reason for anyone to keep records of who was
hatched first, as long as the numbers are all there. Maybe there’s a way
to tell, like counting the bands on our ponytails.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> \#DearAlf when will abe save Sam?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Er, I dunno, Thursday? Pawk ‘n’ Elum, remember when I used to
be an agony aunt and not a prophet? And what’s with the knight’s duty
stuff now, when did we become the royal guardians?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> and when do mudokon queens lay female eggs?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Errrrrrmmmmmm. Thursday.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> PS: also, how do mudokon drones look like?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Big eyebrows.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, I’ve got something that’s been pickin’ at my
brain for a while. Since the Mudokun Queen Sam (funny how she and I both
have the same name) wasn’t in Vykker’s Labs when it blew up in Munch’s
Oddysee, could it be possible that she’s in the industial capitol where
Lady Margret is? I mean, it’s the perfect place ‘cuz it would have the
highest security. The only difference is that Margret gets treated like
royalty and the only thing poor Sam gets are anti-depressents. So what
do you think? Should you and Abe check out the capitol for your mom.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Will you guys just drop thi- wait, mommy? You gotta be kidding
me. Don’t be doin’ this to me! If I find out we got a mom locked away
somewhere, I’ll cry, so quit yanking my ponytail! I wouldn’t go looking
in the big cities though. Those places are too full of billionaires and
celebrities to be industrial. They’re commercial! Consumer society at
its richest.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> also hows Munch doing with those baby Gabbits?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They’re a coddled bunch o’ scampis, I’m tellin’ ya! Poor Munch
is a tad floundered with parenthood now, but he’ll get his fins for it.
I fillet in my bones!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> \#DearAlf When will be the next Oddworld game with the
Quintlogy? I really want it back. Maybe Just Add Water can do it.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The next, and third, game in the Oddworld Quintology is
Oddworld: Squeek’s Oddysee. It always has been and it always will be.
It’s a big story, one we’ve been hanging on to for a couple of decades,
and when we tell it we want to tell it right. It’s just very dear to our
hearts. Even then, telling a new story is several steps up from what
we’ve been working on with Just Add Water so far, meaning it’s
expensive. Very expensive. The thing is, we’re tired of playing by the
publishers’ rules. That means that everything we make, we have to be
prepared to fund out of our own pocket. And we just ain’t that rich yet,
simple as. But everything we’re doing now is to help build up the Moolah
so we can afford to tell brand new stories, because that’s what we wanna
be doing too! We just gotta share a family-size bucket o’ patience.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> when mudokons going to rescue Sam?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Tongue of a Fleech, I’ll rescue her myself if it’ll pipe y’all
down!

Fun’s over, folks. If I knew you all thought of me as your parental
figurehead, as I like to think I am, I’d tell ya all to get to bed and
leave me alone, uh, I mean, get a good night’s sleep. And clean behind
ya durn ears!

This is my Rehab, and as long as you’re all staying here under my

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Hey there Alf! I was just wondering that where did Abe get his
“special powers”? I mean, how can he just chant, climb and, of course,
fart immediately when he wants? I’ve noticed that he’s the only one
who’s able to do these…

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Any Mudokon can chant if they know what noise to make! It’s
just OHMOHMOHMOHM, or is it NYOWNYOWNYOW, or maybe it was NOMNOMNOMNOM.
Yeah, any fool could pick it up. Just Abe’s… real good at it. Some
shamans study for years to use their chant, and along comes this
slaughterhouse servant with a natural aptitude that sets their envy
afire! That’ll learn ’em to be so uppity ’bout who they lend a paw to!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> We know that Mudokons can have 5 powers:
1 – Chant. (Mudoknons can increasingly variety of species according to
their Karma, isn’t?)
2 – Blue Ring
3 – Red Ring
4 – Green Ring
5 – Yellow Ring
My question is: There is another power that mudokons can have?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well let’s see, there is the purple ring and the orange ring.
Oh, and the brown ring, but I don’t like to talk about that. The pink
ring is really cute, but the gray ring is pretty boring. Then there’s
the cerulean ring, the vermilion ring, the cerise ring, the indigo ring
and my personal all-time favorite, the beige ring!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Wouldn’t body armor be helpful for Abe? \#DearAlf

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Abe’s a pretty nimble guy for someone who’s been cooped up in
tight cells and corridors for most of his life. It’s kinda the only
reason he’s survived as long as he has, apart from that whole ancient
mystical powers bag of tricks. Ya reckon he’s gonna stay that speedy and
flexible wearing body armor? Nah, that armor should be saved for those
of us suffering a much more sedentary existence, perhaps those who help
in passive ways like sitting and talking to recovering addicts. Yes, I
think that.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do you think Abe would possess rich business men/women to give
away all their wealth to the Daniel fund that I will make?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> What an excellent idea! I gotta say, we had so much fun
building up Lulu only to dash him back down to the gutters, impoverished
and neglected by society, never to know comfort or pride again. If you
wanna do the same thing to this ‘Daniel’ guy, count me in!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will Abe be able to roll between a scrab’s legs ?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yeah sure. But like anything else that rolls between a Scrab’s
legs, how many separate piece he’ll come out in on the other side is a
totally different and much splattier question for another day.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear, Alf I want to know if the revival totems in Munch’s
Oddesey (Copyright…you guys) can revive a human into a mudokon, cause i
want to become as Shrykull Powered as abe and live with you guys.  
Mudokons are Righteous  
Glukkons and Sligs can go make out with fleeches  
(hmm, i should invent minty fleech floss!) XD

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They’re resurrection totems, not reincarnation totems. Totally
different technology. It’s one thing to shepherd a recently-deceased
nearby spirit into a new body, it’s quite another to ferry one across
the dimensions. It’d take so long just to get you here your ghost would
be all moldy and wrinkled, and you don’t wanna be revived like that! Ya
gotta be fresh! Minty Fleech Floss can keep you only so hygienic!

That’s all the weekly education I’m budgeted for, so I hope you’re all
now confident in the spiritual energy you can channel. Go pester Big
Face or Raisin if you want any additional guidance. I can guide you
better than them but I don’t wanna.

or are they “wild” Sligs out in the far reaches of Mudos?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> That’s rude. I don’t go asking what you look like with your
pants off. Just coz we don’t wear shirts and ties, don’t mean we gots no
dignity! There’s only two kindsa Sligs in this Oddworld: the kind that’s
got a proper job, and the kind that’s served in a bowl. And I ain’t
feelin’ up for a tenderizing right now, so I’m keeping my work-issue
uniform, thanks pally.
</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> Did Sligs used to be Paramites?

</p>

<p><b>Alf:</b> Yeah sure, and Slogs used to be Scrabs! Bwahahaha! And this

<p><b>Alf:</b> Ya mean all of us? I dunno, some stagnant gutter in the pits
of nature, wallowing in their own pointlessness? Well good riddance to
those meek and pathetic worms! No more writhing in the dirt, we have
massive birthing complexes to bring us into the world! We got an entire
industry dedicated just to us! Ain’t nobody else that special.

Glukkons have Lady Margeret but does Sligs have a mother too? Or are
they Clones?

a mommy. My ma is called Skillya and she’s as big and beligerant as they

<p><b>Alf:</b> Coz that’s where the Moolah is, vachead! You can’t lease your
unrivalled army to every factory franchise on the continent if the
majority of it is partially digested. There’s contracts and quotas to
keep! Mommy works hard so we can all enjoy the legs and bullets she
makes sure we get given.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Also if regular sligs are ugly to the point that even glukkons who see
vykkers don’t want to look at them, how fugly are the queens? Like
cataclysmic levels of fugly?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There’s a reason we don’t carry pictures of mommy in our
wallets!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Can the Slig Queen produce an occasional infertile female?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> An infertile female? What’s the point in that? Did I not
explain the thing about the unrivalled army delivered to every factory
franchise on the continent? A Slig Queen that don’t make Slig Workers is
like a RuptureFarms that don’t make Meech Munchies. Throw it in the
trash with the “kind-hearted Sligs” and the rest of us will get on with
our lives.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Crig bro high four …. so yeah I been meaning to ask for a
long time now are albino sligs only a myth or are they real I heard
about one that did a runner whadda you think

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> High four, slig20! I’ll never get you guys’ obsession with
broken Sligs. “Kind-hearted” this and “mask fell off” that, it’s like
you’re trying to corrupt Sligkind. No, we don’t want our genetics ruined
by freaks and mutants, and any albino bambino reckless enough to get
born should have the common decency to remove itself from the gene pool…
permanently! Remember, variety is the scourge of life!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do you know the albino slig from SligStorm?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I don’t associate with ANY weirdo Sligs, albino or otherwise.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> If yes what’s is name?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No!

<p><b>Question:</b> Did the game ever come out? I’d love to play it.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No!

I’ve had enough of this dump! You guys have no idea what makes a Slig
tick. Shove your flowery teas and your bizarre love of renegade
degenerates! I’m going back to the big city. I might not have a whole
Rehab full of substance-dependent ex-slaves to coerce into subservience,
but there’s 3-for-1 protein meatshakes, medium-speed internet and half
price evenings at Rollocking Rick’s Rifle Range Rental.

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: what do baby scrabs and paramites look like? are they mini
adults, or are they different looking?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Y’know, I never did get close to baby Scrabs or Paramites.
Something about their always put me off. You’d never catch me going near
their nests at the best of times, but when there are cranky, protective
parents on the patrol, yeah, nah, count me out. All I’m gonna say for
certain is NEVER BLOW ON A PARAMITE COCOON.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do Fuzzles require veterinary dental care the way our
dogs do or does their species have tooth enamel that makes ours look
about as protective as a molar covered in donut glaze?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Fuzzles are wild animals and the natural world doesn’t really
have dentists. Sure some birds will pick bits out of large creatures’
mouths, but even they’re not foolish enough to go in a Fuzzle’s mouth.
So if you do have a put Fuzzle, don’t go flossing its teeth… One mild
startle and you’ll be missing more than just a finger!
</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> \#DearAlf Hey Alf Is Abe And The Rest of You Have Pet
Scrabs And Paramites also Are You Friends With Some Glukkons. \<3 you
Alf.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No! You do not keep Scrabs and Paramites as pets! If you’re
really, really, extraoddinarily brave and calm and talented and wise
and patient and lucky, you can “tame” them. It ain’t do with domestics,
it’s more like coming to an agreement that benefits everybody. Friends
with Glukkons? Are you kidding me? Would YOU sit and chat merrily with
your genocidal oppressors? Ya gotta be off yur rocker, mister. \<3 you
too.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, I have a question for you! How do you think you or
any other Mudokon would react if a Scrab just kind of walked into the
village, and just sat there and did nothing agressive? I know it would
be impossible, but maybe it has some brain condition or something and it
got just so confused it didnt know what to do anymore.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Same thing we’d do any dangerous creature came to us, weirdly
calm or otherwise: try and catch it safely and either release it back
into the wild or keep it to use. Maybe the frosty hermit that lives in
the forest wants to commune with it, see if it’s bringing a message. Or
maybe our berries stocks are getting low and we could use the extra
food. Depends how the ecology is goin’, y’know? The call has to made by
a sagely Mud, and with all these newly slaves bumping about, there’s a
big need to relearn all the old wisdom.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf what did meeches eat

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Pretty much anything that crosses their path is gonna get
gnawed to the bone in seconds, but mostly Elums. It used to be one of
the spectacular sights of Mudos, watching a swarm of Meeches take on a
herd of Elums. I mean, so I’ve been told. Guess I’ll never know.

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: And what is with all races in Oddworld having queens?? as in not
Monarchy but Biology?? Only takes one mishap and it’s all over for
Muds/sligs/gluks/slogs/whatever else has a queen

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well it ain’t all the races, but yeah there’s a bunch of us
take that tactic. It’s a pretty good one! I mean why leave everybody to
fend for themselves when everyone can just pitch in towards the survival
of the mommas? With hundreds or thousands of children protecting you,
that would have to be one mishap big enough to destroy any population
anyway. It’s not like there only one queen per species, y’know! Yeep,
ya think we’re new to this?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Question for Alf or Crig the Slig, I’ve seen graffiti on some of
the walls of RuptureFarms and Soulstrom Brewery. Who has doing all of
it?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Don’t tell the brass, but we sometimes get away with it. You’re
stuck in a boring job all day, you come across a bottle of fizzy paint,
the nearest wall starts lookin’ more ‘n’ more like a canvas for whatever
creativity ain’t been beat outta ya. Who cares that someone you care
about could be the schmuck that’s gotta clean up after you? A chance
like that ain’t every day. And no, it ain’t Sligs. Sligs don’t have a
creative cell in their body.

<p><b>Question:</b> is abe a Good guy or a bad guy? Is Abe really a terrorist, like
in a bad way, Alf?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Good guy, dingus. He’s fighting for the freedom of oppressed
people across a whole planet. Just because some cockroaches in top hats
might lose their diamond-encrusted carriages to the revolution, doesn’t
mean you get to buy into their mainstream media agenda-shoving
impropaganda.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dose Abe have a bounty on his head? Cause yanno he’s
considered a terrorist in Glukkon eyes. Do bounty hunters come after Abe
or dose Crig try to capture Abe and turn him in?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Whoever drags Abe to the Magog Cartel, ideally kickin’ and
screamin’, is getting the incentivization of their career – presuming
they don’t learn too much of the wrong kinda thing along their journey.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>

are you left-handed or right-handed?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oh ye of the false-tastic dichotomy! Stuffs don’t gotta be so
one way or the other way only! I’ll have you know I am equally fluent
with both hands at all skilled and unskilled tasks and challenges! I
believe the word for that is ‘ambidexcellent’.

followed by an extreme craving for more or is it a little different?
Seriously what do the put in that stuff other than your Bones and
tears?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Y’know, after finding out that much about what goes into Brew,
I’ve decided we all know far too much about it. If that ain’t enough to
put ya off the sickening stuff for good, you’re either addicted or ya
ain’t got a clue what it’s like. If you’re addicted, then come in my
brother! Let’s get you taken care of with love and teaspect. If you’re
in the dark, get out and stay there—I ain’t inviting you into this pit
of indignity.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> P.S. I Found a six pack mysteriously hiding beneath the floor boards
you wouldn’t have anything to do with it would you? ALF that better not
be yours!!! \>:(

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yeah, that’s mine. I’ve been workin’ out a lot lately. Focusing
on my Scrabs!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Just out of curiosity, does it hurt when Abe speaks?
I’m sure it does with his lips being stitched together and all, but when
I see him talk it looks like he barely has a problem with it.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It hurt for the longest time, but they’ve been there since he
was a minor Mudling crawling underneath sawblades with a blankie and a
washcloth—as an aside, trust me, never get those two mixed up. Whatever
cheapo stitch tech they used on Abe hasn’t stood the test of time,
‘specially since Abe’s gotta be so chatty all day. Remember: Too Much
Talkin’, Lose A Mudokon!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Another question for Alf, How is it that Muds have such
hard slaps? I’ve seen some and they don’t look that strong, but they
look like they have one powerful back hand.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Have you seen the size of our hands? They’re almost a foot
long! It’s not about how mighty we swing, it’s the weight behind it.
Who’d ever need a jet-propelled wrecking ball?

<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf i was wondering have you and your brothers ever messed
with a beehive, and later regret it? Especially when you realize it was
a grave mistake and running for your lives and asking abe for help but
hes faster than you and you can see a bee swarm around you wondering
what went wrong?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I can assure I’ve never messed with a beehive and not regretted
it. I also regret reading your morbid little story. It ain’t like I need
to sleep or nuthin’, honest to bees!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do slogs hump furniture?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Much worse, they chew it. Don’t matter if it’s fabric, wood or
metal, they’ll get their teeth right into that. If ya don’t wanna live
surrounded by decrepit desks, bedraggled beds and wartorn wardrobes,
muzzle that mutt! Handy for keeping the neighbours off your turf,
though.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> please give me advice on how to handle the wait until New n
Tasty

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sure! You could play all the Oddworld games, start to finish,
100% ’em, how ’bout it? And if you get all that done, well I dunno, try
your hand at some Fan Art perhaps? Always happy to have new additions to
my master ‘in’ pile! Take up a hobby, like Scrabdancing or Wolvarchery,
or trying learnin’ somethin’, like Sligonometry or Glukkonomics.

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Will you return in Oddworld: Soulstorm?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You don’t know the things that are going on around here! I wish Abe
would leave me outta it and let me run Alf’s Rehab and Tea in peace. I
can’t read the future though – it’s not like I have the time to sit
around reading tea leaves!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How have you been? Also how come Ed can hear you? He doesn’t seem to
hear anyone else.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I’ve been busy! Ed? Ed’s scared and I can understand that. Sometimes
people can be talkin’ all around you but you can’t hear ‘em. Poor Ed’s
confused and afraid. I’m a familiar face – and have you ever seen a mug
as trustworthy as mine?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Would Abe and Stranger be pals?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They’re very different, but they’re both heroes right? They’re both nice
guys, too. Though Abe might drive Stranger insane with his constant
yappin’. Stranger never was one for small talk.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Was there ever a time when Glukkons and Mudokons had a truce or a
working relationship? Maybe before the introduction of currency and
business?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sure there was, though it was so long ago I wasn’t around to see it. We
lived together as pals until the Mudokon moon first appeared. Then the
Glukkons started dabbling in the kinda magic no-one has any business
playing around with. Maybe they were jealous. As ya might expect things
went wrong, and eventually the Glukkons turned their backs on their old
ways and started turning to money and industrialisation… and we all know
how that turned out.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How do you know Ed? Did Ed work with you?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I know everyone – Abe thinks he has it tough? It’s not easy being such a
celebrity. Everyone comes to me with their problems, and Ed has a lotta
problems.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How’s Ed?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Ed’s in danger and he knows it – Ed’s one brave Mudokon, even though it
might not look like it right now. Ed’s got an important job ta do and
just needs a bit of help to get it done.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How close is the storm? May we please have a glimpse?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I’m back, aren’t I? You think I’d take the time out from restocking the
store rooms if it wasn’t important? I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t
missed this though – it feels good to be back. You want a look? So do I.
I want to know just what’s going on over there. That’s where Ed comes
in. Stick around, pal – big things are happening.

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do you know where Ed might be, Alf?

<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hello. I'm not sure why Abe bumps his head. Sometimes I see
him eating paint chips.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was wondering if you could add a web poll to your site? Also,
what do (or did) Meeches look like?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I'll see what I can do about the web poll.

I have personally never seen a Meech, either first hand or in
photographs. Some say they looked like small hairy pancakes that left
trails of sticky mucous on the ground. Legend has it that on any given
day, one could witness swarms of Meeches squirming by the millions over
the placid fields of Mudos.
</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> Is it hard being an inhabitant? Was Abe the only one that can
transform to Shrykull?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I've got a 47-inch waistline; does my physique suggest to you
that it is hard being an Inhabitant?

I could do the Shrykull thing if I really wanted to, I just don't want
to.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Yo, can you send me some fan equipment man?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Dear Sir, unfortunately we do not include gold chains, spoke
rims, or handguns in our line of merchandise. In addition, our
distribution network does not extend to your part of "da hood" (i.e.
your parent's basement in the suburbs), so we would be unable to fulfill
your order. Seriously, look for stuff in the fall when the game is
released.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why does Abe not get sick when he drinks the SoulStorm™ Brew?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Evidently, he has built up some sort of resistance to the
stuff. You know, each time it takes a little bit more to get the same
effect.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey, would you Mudokons get severely punished if you pulled off
BigFace's mask? Do you know what's under his mask?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Punished? Please! He only wears that thing for the girls. He
thinks it makes him "mysterious" or something. I've seen what he looks
like underneath. Two words - buck teeth.
</p>

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Are you guys going to make an Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee
soundtrack?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, I'm not sure about that, but if we don't... I'm in this
band and we're trying to cut an album and we're really good and I play
the drums sometimes well mostly I play the tambourine but we're really
good and we're going to cut an album and you can buy that instead!

<p><b>Question:</b> Is Paul O'Connor still writing the Munch's Oddysee designer

<p><b>Alf:</b> Look for Paul's next installment of the "Passport to Oddworld"
feature on the Microsoft Games website around e3 time.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Are the Interns pot-bellied from a vitamin deficiency through
lack of eating or do they just look that way?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The Interns lead a sedentary lifestyle. They have gradually
developed a body type known as "the melted candle" whereby deposits of
supple fatty tissue ooze down around their midsection. This phenomenon
is common among those who sit day in and day out in front of a computer
terminal, eating and working, working and eating.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What is a Meep? Is it that one-eyed creature?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Correct. The taste reminds one of chicken, but with a subtle
hint of the sea. Just kidding!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> In Munch's Oddysee, do Abe's eyes move around? In the recent
bunch of screenshots for MO, Abe seems to be sort of staring into space.
The Sligs and Munch look awesome, but Abe looks. . . well, sort of
stupid. Please explain.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You are, of course, entitled to your opinion. Your obvious
lack of training in the studies of anatomy and simple common sense
serves to explain your comments. Abe's eye sockets are of the rotator
cup variety, which allow him to swivel his eyes in virtually any
direction, much like a chameleon. If you saw him "staring into space",
it may have simply been that he felt your gaze and chose to ignore you
by focusing on a distant object.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What's up with Mudokons' body? I can understand you're thin when
you're slaves, but free Mudokons also look anorexic!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> What is this sick pre-occupation with body-types? Is this what
modern media has done to our youth? Listen, if you are overweight and
feel a certain jealousy toward the slim figure of a Mudokon, that is a
problem that you yourself must deal with.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> The only Mudokon names I've seen are Abe and Alf. I was wondering
are there Mudokons that have female names?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well let's see ...I'm not good with names, but there's Pat,
Chris, and Cory. (Insert more androgynous names here). I once knew a guy
who had some sort of operation done and thereafter called himself
"Linda", but I suppose that doesn't count. Not really! I'm just feeling
feisty. Look for Sam the Mudokon Queen to make her debut in Munch's
Oddysee. Don't ask me any questions about her because I can't answer
them. You just gotta be patient.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> In the first two games of Oddworld, can Sligs tell if other Sligs
are possessed? Any time I possess one and say hi to another, they reply,
and then blow me away.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> When Abe was first starting out, he didn't have good control
over his powers. When he'd possess a Slig, the Slig would be all glassy
eyed, and stumble around like a zombie. It wasn't very convincing. He's
gotten much better lately, as you'll see.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why is it that Abe has to die in the bad ending? All the time you
play, you grow more respect for the little guy. Then, at the end, he
gets sliced into bite-sized chunks. Surely Mudokons are more forgiving
than that!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It's not so much forgiveness, as rescuing Abe from the
clutches of Molluck the Glukkon wasn't an easy thing. Especially when
you don't have many lives, rescued mudokons to work with. Chanting like
that to create a rescue portal takes years off your life.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What do you have to do to get a good ending anyway?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Rescue enough guys so that they'll rescue you back. I forget
the exact numbers, maybe half of the totals.
</p>
</div>

<p><b>Question:</b> Hi, Alf. I've got some questions for you here (yes, more). I've
kept them as Universal as I can think them to be, so I hope you don't
spot any that are really "knucklehead." Why is that Slig wearing a dress
on the right of the Land Muggers picture?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> That is a game show host (ess). Since all sligs are male
(except the queen, and she's as big as a house literally) that has to be
a guy slig in a dress. He's following in the fine tradition of Milton
Berle and Monty Python and Ru Paul.
</p>

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do Gabbits build things underwater?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Not that I know of. Gabbits are more like otters, just living
their lives in nature.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why were there no Bats, Bees or Fireflies in Abe's Exoddus? Will
they be returning in Munch's Oddysee or later games?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> We have so many new and wonderful things coming along for the
future, that you'll scarcely notice the bats and bees and fireflies. Big
things, swell things, things that'll make you run crying to Mommy.
You'll be stopping strangers on the street and saying "Hey, buddy, you
gotta see this..."
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I'm sure someone has asked this before, but I couldn't find that
any one did. What is the ending like if you save all 300 Mudokons in
Abe's Exoddus? And what is the ending like if you save all 99 Mudokons
in Abe's Oddysee? Please give me a good answer.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Good question! If you saved all 300 Mudokons in Exoddus and
all 99 Mudokons in Oddysee you basically rock, dude. The ending is Good.

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Alf Please answer my question (I can't wait any longer)! Tell me
about the Glukkon "Lulu".

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Think of LuLu as a bumbling hotshot Vegas type rockstar with
more style than brains. Yeah! Almost like real rock stars!

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: C'mon guys! I've been waiting for the icons and wallpaper for
months! Oh, and some screensavers, too, would be lovely. So how about
it, MAKE WIT DA GOODS! PRONTO!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Now this is feedback I can use! Let me make a note here, let's
see..."Call the folks in production and tell them to stop wasting their
time on all of these games". People are sick of games... what people
want are screensavers and icons! Wow, that was close. You know, there
were tentative plans for icons and such a little later on, but thanks to
you, we can now redirect our efforts towards making this company an
icon-producing machine such as the world has never seen!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> You know that Shrink guy (The Magog Cartel Health Bloke), in the
Oddworld universe industrial characters bit of the web site it says that
he has a track going along the ceiling so he can move. I'm wondering,
can he go on trains and stuff to get to other facilities, or is he
disconnected then put back on in the other facilities?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> That sort of thinking doesn't work here, kid. Sure you could
stick him up on the train tracks and shoot him off somewhere else, but
who pays for it all? You've got transportation fees, rail tolls and
cargo taxes...then there's the land barons, franchise owners and port
supervisors who always take their cut. Much simpler and far cheaper to
just junk the old one and build a new one somewhere else.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> At what resolution will Oddworld games run on the Xbox?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Our resolution will be the same it has always been, to make
the very best games out there!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was wondering why you torture us by never answering any
questions completely, and why your answers seem to never follow the
whole Oddworld atmosphere?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, there's a good reason for this, you see...(burp!)... oh
man, big breakfast today. Hey, has anybody seen that movie Cool Hand
Luke where that guy eats all those eggs? That's what I feel like right
now. Man, I gotta start cutting back. Anyway, what was the question? Ah
well, let's move on shall we?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do Sligs live in the factories or do they get to go home?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sligs are like butterflies in that they live short and
meaningless lives and their very existence is like a pox on the land.
They reach maturity quickly and are immediately assigned to their posts
throughout the industrial empires. They stay on duty 24 hours a day
until they simply collapse. Their limp bodies are then thrown into the
recyclers, converted to a brownish, energy-rich sludge which is served
as a delightful lunch ration in cafeterias everywhere.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Munch broke his leg in a bear trap right, does that mean there
are bears on Oddworld?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Bears? Jeez, I guess there could be bears. You're right, I
mean why would someone lay a bear trap if there were no bears? It's
ridiculous!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Are there Mudokon and Glukkon drones who sit around doing nothing
in the hope of some day "getting lucky" with the queen?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> In this case, use of the term "getting lucky" may not exactly
be appropriate as the queens are essentially enormous sacks of fat
rolls, covered in sweaty lumps, hair and weeping glands. I doubt any
drone would consider himself lucky in the face of such a revolting task.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why have the Sligs eyes changed? In Abe's Oddysee the Sligs had a
visor sort of thing going across their face, and in Exoddus they have
proper eyes. Please explain.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The Slig suicide rate soared during the time those visors were
issued. Sligs began walking off high ledges and stumbling into
bone-crunching machinery more and more often. Studies showed that those
first visors had a small optical misalignment that caused the wearer's
eyes to become crossed. Vykkers scientists quickly modified the
equipment and Slig suicides have subsequently evened out.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I saw in the movies that Abe could pick up Sligs from the back.
Can you ask Abe about any other abilities he has picked up or learned
from his mentors? Perhaps anything heroic or daring?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Why doesn't anyone ever ask me about my heroics? Oh well, hold
on a second... "Hey Abe, this person wants to know what new skills
you've learned!" He's thinking. You know, I can do this thing with my
armpit...oh, hold on again. "Why is everyone laughing?" Oh, heh heh, he
farted. Well, I guess that's a skill.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Should the Fleeches be counted as "wildlife?" They were created
by Vykkers.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> What sort of nonsense is this? Fleeches are most definitely a
creature indigenous to Oddworld, almost as old as the world itself and
may certainly be counted as "wildlife". You must be confused.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do Mudokons have teeth? I'm personally stumped on this one.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Of course! Though in addition to teeth, we have a sort of
"gizzard" that further breaks down food.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why do Abe and other Mudokons wear "skirts?"

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Are your powers of deductive reasoning really that poor?
Surely you can come up with the answer on your own.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is the bird mask that Big Face wears suppose to be the head of
the creature that Mudokons supposedly evolved from?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Good heavens, where do you kids come up with this stuff? Has
Big Face been spouting his crazy talk again? As far as I know, he picked
it up at an old junk shop in exchange for some comic books.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Can you tell us some interesting facts about Paramites that you
know and we don't?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, if you scratch them in just the right place, they do
this really cute kicking thing with their hind leg. Of course that's
just before they turn on you and rip you limb from limb.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What did Vykkers and Interns look like before their (obvious)
operations? (stitches around the limbs, etc.) Will we see what they
looked like? I mean, just because they're Vykkers, doesn't mean they ALL
are in the medical profession.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They look pretty much like you see. The limb replacements are
just to get better limbs than those that they had. Vykkers, like
Glukkons, don't take very good care of their bodies, and need constant
replacement parts. As for profession, Vykkers aren't all doctors,
they're all researchers. Some do medical research, finding new uses for
helpless animals, or new addictive substances to add to the food. Others
invent new kinds of noxious industrial chemicals, or cheaper ways to
suck the value out of the land.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I know Glukkons "worship" Power and Moolah, (and I suspect most
everyone else does too), but I mean OTHER than Power and Moolah is there
a religion on Mudos? Or are there several?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Each species has its own main religion. Mudokons (at least the
natives) revere harmony with nature. Glukkons worship Moolah, as you
guessed. Sligs think that meanness is divine. Vykkers believe that
knowledge (especially the dangerous kind) is king.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was wondering why Sligs always obey the Glukkons? They have
machine guns and grenades to they can easily destroy them, and the
Glukkons don't have any arms.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> O, how I wish it was that easy. Problem is, the Glukkons
control the moolah. Sure, you can blow the blowhards to smithereens, but
then you don't get paid at the end of a week. If you don't get paid, you
can't buy more ammo, or gas for your pants. (Did you know these pants
are gas powered?) And if there's one thing every slig learns, it's don't
get caught without pants or ammo. We all just love to beat on the dopes
who do, and even mudokons will sometimes beat up a pantsless slig. How
embarrassing is that?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What's up with the ever-changing Munch logo? First it's the
needles and stuff one and now it's a soda can. What the heck?!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Shucks. We're just keeping you on your toes out there. Our
fearless leaderis always dreaming up new things. The logo changes you
see are the merest tip of that iceberg of wonder.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Have you ever encountered a Fleech? I just wanted a humorous
answer.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I have not but I know a Slig who has. Crig?

Crig the Slig: Sure, once. It all happened back during Abe's
Exoddus. I was working an outside patrol back then, and I spotted Abe
one night. He was too far to shoot, and I would have just left him, but
there was a reward, and I really wanted that new BlastMaster 350
dual-barrel alternating machine rifle. It's so sweet.

Anyway, I chased him through the gloom until I stumbled into a pit of
Fleeches! Stupid of me, I know, but I was dreaming of that BlastMaster
and how it'd make me big slig in the barracks. Instead, I was pants deep
in hungry mouths with grippy tongues. Good thing I had my gun (don't
leave home without it).

I opened fire on the little monsters, and I got most of them before the
last one sucked me in. By the time I had fired my way out, it ate my arm
off; that's why they call me "lefty". But I was lucky; you should talk
to "no-nose" if you want to hear a real sad story.

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I have a question that’s been bugging me ever since I was a kid,
how did Abe learn to chant in Rupterfarms when he was born into
slavery?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> First of all, Abe is not scary! He’s the least imposing,
friendliest Mud you’re likely to bump into! Unless of course you’re a
factory owner or corporate security lackey. Then I suppose Abe’s chant
becomes something you should fear, yes. Also, thank you to Zach for
sending me the same question no fewer than four times over the last two
weeks!

Something you may not realize is that most of the Mudokons in
RuptureFarms learnt to chant. You can’t not! It’s just that most of us
are chanting “Mercy! Mercy!” or “Rest, please! Rest, please!” in
response to Slig brutality. Abe’s chant was “No! No! No! No!”. Then one
day he was so hungry he ate an old Elum Chub he found in a trash can and
went on a serious trip. Next thing we knew, he was clutching in stomach,
chanting in agony, and all these sparkles were floating around him. We
thought his trip must have become airborne!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, what exactly do you Mudokons recite when chanting?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It’s not anything but a sound. A very important, powerful sound
that brings us closer to the spirit world, but just a sound. Not words.
If you had to transcribe it, maybe it could go “Nyahnyahnyahnyah” or
something? Or is that the noise I make when I answer a fan question in a
snide way?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I’m Just wondering, Have any of Those Pesky Outlaws ever Tried
to give You and your Brethren any Trouble? Besides that Tell Abe I say
Wassup:)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Not me personally, they haven’t, nor any Mud I’ve ever met. The
ruthless lands around the Mongo River are quite a long way from here.
But sure, Outlaws will stoop to all manner of foul deed, including
pestering innocent Grubbs and Mudokons.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hello Alf, I was wondering what its like to hang out with the
Grubbs. Can you tell me? They have a good sense of humor. Also, have you
ever had any Outlaw patients in your rehab?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Grubbs are super friendly folks once you have their trust, but
they’re massively suspicious of outsiders. Can’t blame them with all the
flooding and drought and displacement and poverty and slavery and
badgering and prosecution and genocide that’s been heaped upon them by
Sekto and Wolvarks and Outlaws and Clakkerz. Personally, I reckon their
reliance on the Steef led to their passive and weedy nature, but all
props to them, they knew how to hold an uprising when the time was
right.

I’ve never had an Outlaw in my rehab. They’d be welcome, albeit under
close scrutiny, but they just don’t care about their health that much.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Alf (forgive me if I haven’t been doing my homework),
presumably Mudokon eggs very rarely hatch into females, which slowly
swell up into giant slug ladies with oozing breasts. Would the Glukkons
notice if one of the Mudokons was female? And what would they do if it
was? Who are the Glukkon eggs raised by, and what facilities are there
to care for any species of young queen that may happen to hatch? Things
could get awkward with giant oozing-breast slug ladies cramping the
place up.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They’d certainly notice. Sam is a — shall we say — fecund
momma, but ultimately she’s not going to be a reliable source of slave
labor for long. For all we know, she could be willfully withholding any
female offspring. We don’t exactly get taught Mudokon biology in
nursery. Our eggs are shipped to factories where we’re hatched and given
a broom or pickaxe and left to slave for our survival. It’s a grim
system, and whoever led us down this path deserves very bad things.
Quarma. Just sayin’.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf i was just wondering, if mudokons are slaves in
factories and the other free mudokons are living with nature, who buys
soul storm brew or meat products from rupture farms because no mudokons
have money (they wouldnt get paid if there slaves and if there living
with nature they wouldnt need money) so who buys the products??? thank
you for your time and thank you for answering my other questions

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> First of all, Mudokon slaves can get some form of discretionary
pay. We have to eat, after all, and it makes sales figures all the
better if we have to pay to do that. Knowing we could have an extra
Tasty Treat that week can be a good incentive to strive for a bonus. We
haven’t seen the target markets of Glukkon goods yet, but we’re heading
there.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> This is my question: has Oddworld a single language, or Abe,
Munch, Stranger and the other characters speak the Mudos’ language?
Beside the one spoke by the fuzzles.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> We speak a common language because that’s the only way we can
hold together a multi-species civilization, at least in the small
territory of Mudos. Native races have their own ancient tongues that
have fallen out of practice, along with large swathes of our cultural
heritage.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> dear alf,  
(not that i dont like him)but abe isnt the smartest creature on
oddworld, so why does he get a moon, it would make more sence to give a
smarter creature a moon  
just saying  
stay odd

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> A smarter creature like whom? Glukkons have amazing business
smarts. Vykkers are incredibly intelligent. But these things don’t
matter as much as what a person accomplishes, and Abe has accomplished
so very much. I’d call him a Professor of Soul if that didn’t make him
sound like a singer.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> This is one of my all time favorite games, but I want to
know. How does it feel for abe to get shot, crushed, exploded, and
eaten? Does he remember it all, Does he feel Pain?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Does Abe feel pain when he’s shot, crushed, exploded and
eaten? Well, gee, I dunno. What do you think?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Two questions : do the Mudokans get like, royalties, or
something? Y’know, from the retelling of Abe’s epic tale?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> For every copy of the Oddboxx sold, a new bird portal opens in
some horrible Glukkon factory. Don’t delay, purchase now!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> And has anyone tried to get the Glukkons to pay reparations for the
enslavement of so many?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I can’t think of a less useful endeavor. If you get a parcel
from Magog Express claiming to contain reparation, it’s more likely to
contain tear gas or Brew than anything beneficial to your ongoing
freedom.

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Hello,Alf!I have a question…again:How long is a day on
Oddworld compared to a day on Earth.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I can’t possibly answer! The elapse of a time interval observed
by you and me would differ according to our relative motion, and since
there is no physical relationship between Oddworld and Earth, there is
no frame of reference. Hope this helps!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> And how many days do you have in a year?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Just over a year’s worth.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Here’s another question, for your pleasure: has Oddworld its
own weekdays? I dunno, like mudsday, glocksday, vykksday.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I guess we have weekdays, but I sure don’t remember there ever
being any weekends when I was “employed.” For slaves, every day is
“Slogday”. Haha. See what I did there?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I have a Question regarding Lulu, Where is he now? Shoveling
Sleg Dung or Acting as target practice for some outlaws somewhere?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Buddy told me this rumor that he’s been earning a pittance
appearing in commercials for security firms. He plays the loser who
doesn’t think to hire decent security before carrying around something
rare and expensive, and ends up having it stolen. Where do these ad
writers get their zany ideas?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> P.S. Where did you get that nice Fez from?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I grew up on the tale of The Fez in the Forest, which went
something roughly like there was a fez lodged in the middle of a forest,
but despite searching their best, nobody could find it. The person who
did retrieve it was said to be destined to go on to great things. So I
bought one from a shopping channel. Who wants the responsibility of
great things when all you’re after is a neat hat?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was spelunking in some caverns along the Mongo recently
and stumbled across a rock painting of a steef locked in battle with a
gloktigi (I think). The style was very similar to that used by the
mudokons, and it got me wondering: was the graffiti was done by the same
person, or do grubs and muds frequent the same art classes?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Believe it or not, Mudokons and Grubbs outsource their rock art
to the same company, nGravia. It’s really the only option if you want
that high-quality-but-primitive-looking style.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Alf, I’ve got a question about Stranger’s Wrath. Why
is Doc The Vykker have a kind of creamey coloured skin and green and
yellow eyes but just about all (If not all) the Vykkers in Munch’s
Oddysee have Pink skin and Yellow eyes? I have many theories and shall
tell you them after you answer me. In fact I though of one today.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You’re saying if I don’t answer you, I won’t get to hear your
theories? Well shoot. Hey, I have my own theory. The Doc is actually the
saviour of his people, his alternative pigmentation a clear fulfilment
of ancient prophecy. He’ll probably go on to discover Native Vykkers and
start freeing his race. I haven’t heard from him in a while, though. I
wonder what he’s up to these days.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> if blind mudokens only have their eyes stiched, cant you just
unstitch them?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It’s technically possible, but a lot of Mudokons prefer to keep
their stitches. They’ve long since adapted to what others would label a
disability and consider it a part of their identity.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> speaking of sowing, why does abe how a stitched mouth?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Chicks dig body modification.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> who eats the paramite pies and scrab cakes?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Anyone who wants a delicious, nutritious, cruelicious snack!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> will there be games totally outside of Mudos and Abe
altogether. it would be nice because I’d like to see more races, places
and other aspects of Oddworld.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Why? Trying to escape from Alf? Not been following your detox
program? HMM? Fingers crossed we will explore territories far away,
totally isolated from familiar Mudosian nature and society.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hey alf. i have a few questions. 1. do mudokens have any
national holidays or events? like a day where they all come together and
drink tea commemorating abes heroic actions to save them?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Dear Idiot, I would be delighted to answer your questions,
although I have forwarded your second one to Crig. Mudokon celebrations
vary hugely, just like your own. They tend to align with natural events,
like the first day of spring when we can take off our winter loincloths,
or the harvest of crops when we can stuff our faces again, rather than
having institutionalized calendar days. That said, I’ve been campaigning
for a Tea Day for a few years now.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 3. do mudokens ever play games? or are they workaholics?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Have you not met a Mudokon before? We are lazy, with a capital
laze. Could you pass me my drink?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> and last question: are mudokens traditionally skinny? i know that most
of them are skinny beacuse of rupture farms/soulstorm brewery,
torchering them and overworking them. but dont you guys eat alot when
you get back?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It’s not a tradition, it’s the natural consquence of living
either in captivity or off the land. There isn’t an excess of food or a
shortage of work in either case. Maybe if there were Mudokons leading
sedentary lifestyles in big commerical environments you’d see a wider
variety of body shapes.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> also does the mudokens rubber like skin restrict there weight? (i
remember reading an awnser you gave back at the last homepage about how
they dont die when they fall from a cliff and land in OWMO) anyway
thankyou for your time and hope these questions arent just a waste of
your prescious time

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I’m touched that you’ve been paying me so much attention. I
wish I could return the favour, but you can’t have two last questions!
NEXT!
</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf! Greetings from France :3 i just wondered, what do
Mudokons take when they have a stomach ache or intestinal disorder?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Are you trying to get me to answer something like Sekto Abismol
or Imudium?

</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, this question is more for Crig than for you, i guess, but
here it is: Did anyone ever see the Slig’s Queen (Skillya is her name i
think, something like that as far as i remember) ? i guess there isn’t
any picture available even if someone saw her, huh? =T thanks in
advance

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I guess it’s time to bring Crig out. CRIG! YOU’RE UP! I’m off
to bed.

Anyone ‘lucky’ enough to see Skillya is generally not going to
leave her premises outside of a tin can. I’m certainly in no hurry to
pay her a visit, and I don’t think you’ll find anyone who is. Upper
management might have met with her to negotiate contracts, but I’m not
going to ask them.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2. is there such thing as a female slig? or do they kind of
have a the same situation as mudokens? (only having one female to
reproduce)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It’s the same as Mudokons, there are queens that handle all
the reproduction. Skillya is just one of several.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I know this might be the hard question to answer, but
stay with me on this one… Sligs are one of my favourite characters, and
I always wanted to know more about them. I’ve read on Oddworld wiki
websites that they’re all raised by slig queen Skillya… But thats it. I
always wanted to know how they live in their barracks, what they do in
free time, how they pick jobs (Slig schools for guards, and pilots?),
all that kind of stuff. Do they have ranks, maybe like slig officers?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sligs don’t generally get to pick their own careers, they’re
treated as the property of the queens that lease them and the CEOs that
rent them. Bosses might send their Sligs to be given training, or the
Sligs can pay for it themselves, but a Slig is rarely given any
education before being put to work. In our free time we like to play
cards, gamble, hunt, and make life miserable for those under our
command. That includes other Sligs.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Are there any other variations of Slig on Oddworld? We’ve got the
bog standard walking Slig, flying, Big bro. Are there any paramedic
Sligs?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There are other variations. The snooty Slig Air Corps pilot
craft that make flying harnesses look like homemade crap. There are Slig
Tanks, mounted Sligs, Sloghandlers, anything there’s a market for. For
all I know, there are Ninja Sligs, but I doubt it. Paramedic Sligs
wouldn’t really serve any purpose. If you lose your units in combat,
just buy some more for cheap.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How come RuptureFarms-sligs wear one-eyed masks, while
SoulStorm-sligs wear two-eyed masks? Is that only a trend, different
from place to place? Or an evolution of the masks?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The two-eyed masks are a newer, superior model. RuptureFarms
wasn’t exactly known for its modern technology.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Also, will we ever see a real slig face without a mask?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Only if you’re very, very unlucky.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was also wondering if slogs sometimes fight each other? For example,
for domination, when two alpha-leaders-slogs meet, just like
alpha-scrabs. Or even, when someone throws one bone for two slogs.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Of course, that’s their natural way to maintain a social
order. Fortunately, civilized society has developed advanced behavioural
training techniques precision engineered to beat Slogs senseless into
submission to Sligs and only Sligs. We can’t have guard animals turning
on one another when they should be turning on upstart slaves.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> alf uh i wondered this, did the slogs originally kill sligs?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sloghuts have staff casualties just like any other facility.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> and crig, did you like your old boss mullock? he really bossed you
around eh? XD

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No, I didn’t work at RuptureFarms.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> In Abes Exoddus Sligs can’t jump but the slig reporter
can…Why?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I’m not sure. Maybe his job came with extra bouncey legs, or
paid him enough that he could buy them. It’s not like you need a spring
in your step patroling a factory.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hello Alf, Whatever happened to the Newscaster slig from M.O.M
news?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> He jumped.

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: So, are you particularly good friends with Abe??

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Emily, come on now! I’m Abe’s best bud in the whole world! I
was there with him in RuptureFarms, I was there with him in the desert,
I was there with him above the Big Well. We could never be separated!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> And also, I’ve wondered are there any female Mudokons, or are they
hard to come by? I’ve never seen any in the games and began to wonder.
What do they look like??

SomeDude: Hi alf ive got 3 questions why are there no females
inhabiting oddworld other than queens

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Jeez, where did you kids go to school? You better brush up on
your basic biology. Listen up: The female Mudokons are the queens, and
you haven’t seen them yet. The male Mudokons are the drones, and you
haven’t seen them yet either. The drones and the queens do all the
breeding for the whole species, while most of us down in the trenches
doing all the hard work are biologically sexless. The breeders are rare,
and us workers outnumber them by hundreds or thousands. Think about how
bees and ants and even some mammals go about things and realize your
reproductive model ain’t the only one out there!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> and have u ever seen a mudombie

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I try to keep away from creepy old graveyards, but… I saw one
once. I think. It was outta the corner of my eye. I didn’t stick about
to double take! Nothing like a soulless lumbering husk of a Mud to
remind you of your mortality.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf. I wonder what mudokons eat every day. Can you tell me?
And what’s your favourite food?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Mudokons eat what they can find, gather, harvest and hunt
sustainably. Fruits, leaves, grains, meat, fish, and anything we can
cook out of them all. We have a broad palette. That’s part of the reason
we get made slaves more than any other natives: we can live on the
processed rubbish and byproduct sweepings. My favourite dessert is
genodda cake!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I noticed mudokons can climb surfaces like Geckos and frogs (
earthling creatures ) which is shown in Abe’s Exodus, how come this
can’t be done in the actual game play?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Mudokons can climb some rough surfaces like wood or stone, but
it makes our hands really dry and achey so we can only do it, say, once
every few days. In hindsight we probably shouldn’t have used up that
ability before the game had even begun, but that’s hardly the biggest
regret I have after the whole Necrem ordeal.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf Where Do Mudokons Go After Abe Rescues Them Through
The Bird Portal?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They go to the Monsaic Sanctum to get all cleaned up and
introduced to their new life. The guys there keep a supply of tea going
(Alf’s Rehab brand, of course) for the newly free Muds that are in an
advanced state of addiction. Tea solves everything. Except the cracks in
my store cupboard. Tea ain’t done a thing to fix that, no matter how
much I pour it on.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> About the laughing gas in Exoddus… How come every other
mudokon goes crazy while breathing the stuff, but abe is just normal?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Ummmmmmm, his stitches absorb all the gas before it enters his
lungs. That’s right.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> It is true that Abe is caring a cub Slog, and currently, is
succeeding in taming him?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> If Abe is even half as smart as he seems—and he ain’t exactly a
genius to begin with—he won’t be doing that any time. Maybe if you got a
Sloggy as soon as it was born or hatched, and you took care of it in the
most loving and tender way, maybe it wouldn’t maul your face off. Do you
want Abe to take that risk?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why Abe don’t use Slingshot, like some Mudokons that we see in Monsaic
Lines?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Where’s he going to carry all the rocks he’d need to fire? He
can only fit nine in his back pocket at the best of times, stick a
slingshot in there and he’s got room for only one or two. And it’s not
like bags of rocks are around every corner in those big factories. He’d
be carrying a tool he could only use once or twice, and quite frankly he
never needed it anyway.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Abe can chant and possess an enemy when he’s crouched?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yeah he figured out how to do that not long before he went
looking for Munch. That’s why he managed to possess Lulu and outbid
every other Inhabitant for that last can of Gabbiar, all while kneeling!
Will his list of talents never end?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What’s happend if a Scrab and a Paramite meet? Who going to win, if
have a fight?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Ah! The age old question! The Six Skillyan Moolah Question. The
question to end all questions except, logically, itself. One single
Paramite up against one single Scrab? The Scrab would win. No sweat. The
question should be how many Paramites would it take to guarantee the
Scrab’s defeat. Or maybe it’s an extra large Paramite, or an extra small
Scrab, or both! What about a Fleech-sized Scrab fighting a Sea Rex-sized
Paramite? Or you could throw in an extra Scrab, so the two Scrabs fight
each other while the Paramites scratch away at them from relative
safety. Or maybe anywhere near two Scrabs wouldn’t count as safety at
all. Boy oh boy, sure hope I don’t develop a critter baiting habit!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, does Abe ever feel any remorse for killing glukkons or
sligs? I mean when it comes to the glukkons Abe is basically killing
completely unarmed creatures. I understand that he has had quite a
troubled past with the glukkons and sligs, and I definitely agree that
the big businesses on Mudos need to be shut down for the muds sake. But
Abe just seems like too nice a guy for brutally ripping things to pieces
when he unpossesses them. Perhaps he should try negotiating instead, and
if that doesn’t work then he can go on to sabotage.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Look buddy, I’ll be the first to admit that Abe ain’t the
sharpest splinter in the plank, but it don’t take a degree in Glukkonomy
to see that these industrial creeps pack their negotiation chambers with
gas and spikes, not tea and biscuits. If you wanna negotiate, you gotta
have cards to play with. “Excuse me boss, could you shut down your
factory, and in return we’ll not whine when you chop us up into
confectionery” ain’t a good bargain.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is Sekto a cross between a Glukkon and a Vykker or some other
dastardly race of creatures? If so, will we see more Sektoians?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> A cross between a Glukkon and a Vykker, yuck! That has to be
one of the most horrible things I could image. But Sekto is something a
hundred times worse. Sekto is an Oktigi. I’m not surprised you haven’t
heard of them, they’re fiercely private and clandestine, yet they remain
one of the richest and most powerful forces in corporate Mudos. Sekto is
the tip of a ruthless iceberg.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf how you doing mate? anyway my question is if the
glukkons had legs and weapons etc manufactured for sligs why have
glukkons never taken the initiative and had a suit of armour that could
protect them or even give them some kind of combat ability.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You ain’t musing like a Glukkon! Think about it! You’re running
a business, making processed foods or yike parts or phatteries or
whatever. Your success is your profit, your wealth, your status, and
that’s how you dress: the finest tailored suits, the rarest jewelry, the
widest shoulder pads anyone did ever see! You’re supposed to be hiring a
personal army to stop threats getting anywhere near you. Wearing armour
is like announcing failure, and that’s when your stocks plummet.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey alf, a few of my friends and I were wondering about the
races of Oddworld. Can you tell me the average lifespan of Vykkers?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I sure can! Vykkers live for about 120 years. That’s about
three times your average Mudokon! But who can say how much is the
natural lifespan Odd gave them and how much is bonus years they’ve
scraped together with drugs, transplants and gene-splicing?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Alf! I simply got one, no two questions for you.
How did the Sligs manage to survive as a species before they were given
legs by the Vykkers? And how did they use to spend their days without
these legs? It gotta be quite hard to move around doing stuff without
em…  
If you really dont know the answer. Tell a joke. I’d love that. Tell
two, and I will give you a cyberhug.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sligs are pretty useless. They survived by keeping out of
everyone’s way. They spent their days feeling sorry for themselves. Not
a surprise they jumped at the chance to take out their frustrations on
lowly Mudokon slaves as soon as it was offered to them. A couple of
jokes, hmmm. What do you call a Slig without pants? Anything you like!
How do you make a Slig fire? Give it a gun! Hahahahaha!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Another thing, are there any native sligs left? Like not
working for the Glukkons?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sligs are born in captivity and leased out at birth. They’re
suited up slugs, they can’t escape to a life of anything but getting
stepped on or possibly salted.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf,I was wondering if you can tell me how big is Rupture
Farms,SoulStorm Brewery,FeeCo Depot and Vykkers Labs.And by how big,I
mean length and width and height.Can you tell me please?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I’d get my yardstick and trek the hundreds of miles to them and
spend days taking measurement and doing trigonometry and working out
their dimensions, but tragically they’re mostly all blowed up. So sad.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is Squeek’s symbiosis parasitic or more benificial to
the host?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> What’s that you say? You want me to host a party! I am so up
for that! We can have cakes and dancing and play Hide & Squeek. Wait,
did I already make that pun last month?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 1. What do Brain Slurgs look like? You’ve given contradictory
descriptions of brain slurgs and I want the honest answer, no offense.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They’re about eight-foot across, roughly ocean-shaped with
flaps of casual menus. Their skin is surrounded by a ceramic second
skin, which has puddles of silk in it. They move by spinning their
nostrils, but don’t let one get near your ear or it will crawl in!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2. Will Munch’s Exodus possibly be made/ in the works already?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It’s a possibility for one day but it’s not in the works
already.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hey alf why is it that new and tasty is coming to xbox but
munch and stranger,s wath is not?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Because New ‘n’ Tasty is a new game and isn’t restricted by the
same rules that Munch’s Oddysee HD and Stranger’s Oddysee HD are. XBLA
classes them as rereleases and imposes different rules.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi alf! Can you tell to Lorne and the Oddworld team that they
can make a game where the story is before Abe’s Oddysee.  
I think that is a good idea, and it will call Abe’s Origins, or Abe’s
First Test, or Abe’s Legens…

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> That’s a wonderful idea! You can play as Abe, the
happy-go-lucky slave who does nothing of consequence, learns nothing
about the world of deception around him, and ends up in exactly the same
place he started and has been all along. Hold the arrow to push the
floor waxer at a steady pace along all the corridors! Press exciting
buttons that dispense your daily meal! Sit and watch helplessly as you
get beaten by meanie supervisors! Earn that coveted promotion from Floor
Waxer, Second Class to Floor Waxer, First Class and become the
uselessly-titled Employee of the Year. Abe’s Origins: the epic tale of
what happened before anything interesting happened.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf! when you want to come to the Earth Someday…. what is
the first thing that you want to see??? ^\_^

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> All the fans!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Ever thought about opening a tea place on our planet? It
could give a boost of moolah.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It’s not about the Moolah! It’s about rescuing lost souls! I’d
love to help chumps across as many planets as I can stretch my paws to,
but tragically I hate commuting. So sad.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> and lastly which galaxy does oddworld locate in?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Uh, the Oddromeda Galaxy. No wait, Sligittarius! Or maybe
Mudellanic Cloud?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is your tea from Mudokons or something else?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> …my tea is most definately, absolutely, undeniably,
categorically, superseismically NOT made from Mudokons. Sheesh!
</p>

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Hi Alf. is it true that a slig’s face is so ugly, that they
have to wear masks?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I’ve never actually had the displeasure of seeing an unmasked
Slig, but I can assure you with complete confidence that they are the
ugliest things you will ever see. The masks are required so that
Glukkons can work with Sligs without losing their lunch, and so the
Mudokons don’t just die of fright. It’s making my tummy feel weird just
thinking about it.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> {1} Do you think inhabitants would buy soulstorm brew if it
was made of somthing else?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I’m sure there are Inhabitants who would enjoy the taste of a
Brew made without any of the unethical ingredients, labor standards,
trading tactics or marketing ploys. Thinking of starting an ethical
company?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> {2} Have mudokons ever thought of going into hiding from glukkons and
the other industrialists?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well it’s not like we’re giving them maps to all our villages
and sacred sites. Can you imagine the logistics of a whole species going
underground? The stress, the hassle… Plus there’s the question of
whether we want to spend our days on the run, or would we rather try and
lead enjoyable lives as much as we can. I’ll tell you the answer. It’s
whichever one lets me sit in the sun and make tea.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> {3 (final questions)} What happened to elum after abe’s oddsyee?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> He was kidnapped by a band of travelling Outlaws and made to
carry heavy loads until he was rescued by a passing Slig looking to sell
it to a nearby RuptureFarms for a quick buck. Tragically the Slig
tripped up on a SpooceShrub and landed face-first in a nest of angry
Fuzzles, who made short work of him. Elum wandered on his own until he
came across a Grubb village. They took him in despite their meagre food
supply, but were raided by Wolvarks, who kept Elum and made him fight
against various wildlife they found. One day when the Wolvarks were on
high alert, Elum broke free and ran until he was far away. He sheltered
in a cave, but it turned out to be the hive of a Paramite colony. He was
about to get eaten by the Paramite Queen when a group of plucky Mudokons
came to harvest a bunch of webbing. They rescued Elum and took him to
their village, but shortly afterwards Vykkers Labs passed overhead and
Elum was abducted by Vykkers, who chopped him up for no reason. The end.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I remember back then, eleven years ago (Tempus Fugit xD),
I watched a great trailer about Munch’s Oddysee Beta for PS2. I was very
excited and I couldn’t wait for buy it. Then, some years passed and I
saw a completely different trailer about the same game, but completely
modified for XBox. My questions are: What happened to that game that it
wwas going to be released for the PS2? And there’s a chance to play that
old Beta for PS2?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The videos you saw were pre-rendered on PCs, not realtime PS2
footage. They were speculative features, not ones that would definitely
make the final game. Not much was done on PS2 before we came to realize
the Xbox was a far superior platform to code for.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Heya, freaks! I was wondering….how does YOUR fart smell
compared to Abe’s?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Abe goes into Glukkon factories a lot and has to survive on the
horrible things they keep in Vendos. Consequently, his farts smell
artificial and plasticky. I stick by the goodly products of nature, so
my farts smell like elderflowers and rose petals.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> It’s me, that Oddworld Forums moron (saved you the
trouble of insulting me). I was wondering, in Munch’s Oddysee, there was
the mystical mixture in a vending machine. It healed you completely
but…it was called Sobee, or something like that. I’m pretty sure we have
a drink like that too. Why did it show up on Oddworld?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hey there moron, good to hear from you. This is either a
fantastic coincidence the likes of which speculative fiction has never
even contemplated, or we wanted to thank SoBe, who had given us a glut
of free publicity in the run-up to Munch’s release. It was an act of
kindness, but the fans turned round and ripped our throats out. Don’t
worry, we’re friends again.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 1) Glukkons are very…”odd” looking creatures without their
suits. But i always wondered why they do a sort of woddle when they
walk? I can only think its they are simply very starchy suits.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They’re probably going to the opposite extreme in trying to
hide the fact their “legs” actually go up to their shoulders.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2) If the decision is made to remake the first game, will it have abes
newly found voice or his “still a slave” voice?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Abe says he’s thinking of doing a Lorne Lanning impression this
time.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 3) Ever consider selling mudokon free Soulstorm brew?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Boy this is a popular question. Well, the more Mudokon-free the
marketplace is, the happier we’ll all be. But I don’t own the SoulStorm
brand, so I won’t be touching it.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 4) Will future games possibly take advantage of voice recognition so
when i say “hello” “all of ya” and “follow me” abe says it?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> That’s a brilliant idea! I’m going to write that down on a
piece of paper and file that piece of paper in our “Ideas from fans”
box. It’s most definitely not a shredder.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 1.When Mudokons get sick, do you create a special, spiritual
tea with special, spiritual herbs or something?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sure, sometimes I do that. But we’re not daft when it comes to
medicine; we know there’s no single cure-all magic that’s going to get
the sickest Mud springing onto his feet, singing and dancing. No, of
course not! That’s why we use a whole range of preventative and curative
substances, including infusions, tisanes and even decoctions!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2. Do the industrialists ever buy your tea?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> If they did, they’d force me into riduculous contracts to
supply huge quantities for nothing a month. They’d penalize me for not
meeting quotas, confiscate my home and all my possessions, and put me to
work in some factory. That’s the kind of “buying” industrialists do.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 1: Did you ever got the chance to eat Meech Munchies before
the main ingredient got screwed?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yeah I did, and those were some moreish treats, I can tell ya!
The nationwide withdrawal symptoms from that extinction probably boosted
sales of similar snacks. I wonder if that’s what drove Scrabs and
Paramites so close to the edge.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2: Another food related question, approximately how much moolah are
scrab cakes worth right now?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well I don’t know, do I! It’s not like I secretly buy and
stockpile Glukkon foodstuffs for desperate ex-slaves! Sheesh! Are you
considering purchasing some? Dude, not cool…
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What was Aslik’s glukkon ranking? he was called
vice-president (dunno bout what), yet he wore somewhat smaller clothes
than his other 2 colleagues Phleg and Dripik, and he also smoked small
(yet somewhat fancy looking) cigars, so it makes me kinda confused to
recognize his social ranking. What do you think about it Alf?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I think if I’m not going to be the one to write his biography,
I’m not going to be the one to research his career. He probably just
thought small was stylish. Or maybe he was decompensating for something.
Use yur imagination!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf: I would like to know as to why Abe drank Soulstorm
Brew, knowing that it was made from the bones of his ancestors. I know
he’s brave when he has to be, and he did it for the sake of his friends,
but he would have some form of hesitation would he not?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oh, I’m sure he did! He must have done. Yeah, he probably was
hesitant. Although he’s never actually mentioned it as being an
unenjoyable experience.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, how do I increase my memory capacity? I’ve been
rather forgetful lately…

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You need to buy some of my amazing RecollecTea. It’s much more
effective than that Glukkon cider: Rememberg.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hi alf im only 13 but im a big fan of oddworld and is there
baby mudokons?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hi Devon, I’m only 15 but I’m a big lover of Oddworld fans and
there is baby Mudokons. They’re the things that come out of the eggs and
slowly turn into full-grown Mudokons. Now go and do your homework!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Was always curious what the tusked creature guardians from
Necrum grounds looked like if they were living

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oh sure, I’ll just pop along to the Glukkon Museum of
Preserving Fossils Despite Not Being Profitable and take a few shots of
the immaculately preserved specimens they have in there for all to see
for no reason. Then I’ll go and see the boffins at the Vykkers Time
Travel Division to take part in their Seeing What Extinct Creatures
Looked Like program. I think it’s safe to say this is a drawing where
you’re free to flex your artistic license. Just stay on the plausible
side and don’t give them caterpillar tracks, ‘kay?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> On off topic if you could drink Earth’s fruit tea which you pick?
Green tea
Vanilla
Lemon
Strawberry
Cranberry with elderflower

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You’re only gonna let me pick one?? Oh man, how can I choose?
They all sound so yummy. Except vanilla tea, that sounds ghastly. Oh,
just give me the strawberry and be done with it. Wait, is it too late to
change my mind to cranberry??
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> On a final note will hand of odd and slig storm see light of day as
games? That be Epic

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oddworld: The Hand of Odd will be delivering next year.
SligStorm is one of those ideas we had that didn’t get far, but it’s
still in our “One Day” drawer.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hiya Alf, I was wondering why it seems like every species
(except the aquatic Gabbit) will drown if they are throw/possesed into
water, even Muds. Considering the amount of water all over the place,
why hasn’t anyone learned how to swim? You could always ask Munch for
some pointers. If Muds learned to swim, they’d be safe from everything
else!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yeah, everything that doesn’t have a gun.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is it possible for a mudukon to posses another
mudukon?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Absolutely not, that would be just far, far too weird!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What are the chances of seeing the Shrykull again in new oddworld
games, or will we see new and even more awesome transformative demi-god
beasts? maybe you’ll be granted your own one Alf?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Shrykull is an amazingly useful power that I’m sure will make
sense in many future games. Should I have a transformative ability of my
own? I guess I kind of do: I transform drunks and addicts into healthy,
happy individuals. Shut up, it’s good work! I don’t need you waving
magic and lightning bolts under my nose!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> The Glukkons are clearly pissed at Abe and the rest you you
guys who escaped Rupture farms, Soulstorm brewery etc. So why have they
not just sent in the masses of slig troops they have and stomp out the
resistance? Do you think this is all part of there plan? or are they all
just a bunch of shmucks?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They’ll certainly be keeping an eye on the situation in case
things become that bad, but military operations aren’t cheap. Why spend
Moolah on excursions when it could go towards luxury designer outfits,
furniture and blimps? The only guys who benefit are the military
equipment manufacturers and Skillya. Maybe they are pushing for a large
invasion of native land. Or maybe they’re sitting safely in their highly
fortified facilities waiting for matters to escalate so they can profit
from an even larger, longer-lasting conflict. There’s a fine line
between the devious cunning and obstinate stupidity of those industrial
fools.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Also what do paramite pies and scrabs cakes taste like? Thanks for
your time, I have been a fan since i was 8.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I don’t know how to describe it, what words can I use? Paramite
Pies taste like Paramite meat with pastry… eh, you see my difficulty?
Try them yourself if you really have to know. Being a fan since you were
8 is impressive. When I was 8 I was scrubbing giblets off of metal
grille floors and feeding them back onto production lines, often at
gunpoint.

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Hey, Alf! Your fez is awesome, would you be kind enough to
get/make me one as good as your one?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Thanks, chump, my fez is awesome. It’s a one-of-a-kind, which
means as much as I’d love to take a few days out of helping sick
Mudokons to try my paws at millinery, it’s not going to happen. Have you
considered a Stetson?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> alf r there native Glukkons?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oddworld is a big place. Maybe in the depths of some exotic,
pristine jungle or deep underground in forgotten caverns there are
native Glukkons. Black swans, and all that. My personal bet is that no,
all Glukkons are greedy jerks.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> alf i know that Glukkons know about abe but do they know about you

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I was a registered “employee” of RuptureFarms 1029, so I exist
on Glukkon paperwork. At least, any paperwork that survived the
destruction of that nightmarish slaughterhouse. Who knows if they’re
plotting terrible things against my Rehab chain, but I don’t think I’m
high on their list of priorities.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hay alf do all sligs have bosses?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Pretty much. A Slig wouldn’t get very far if he didn’t have a
wage-paying boss. His pants would fall into disrepair, he’d run outta
ammo, he wouldn’t have vending machines to get his dinners from, no
chance of promotion, no buddies to hang about with, no slaves to beat. A
free-roaming Slig would have to be one tough survival machine.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I posted images of Oddwold on my Facebook to show it to the
world. I hope you don’t mind

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Not in the slightest! Thanks for spreading the word of Odd! Or
in this case, the images of Odd.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> at the soulstorm brewery why would vykers be working there ?
because there is a sign which mentions vykers ?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Vykkers are renowned for their scientific prowess, so if you
want everyone to know your edible product is safe to consume, you put a
Vykkers seal of approval on it. Doesn’t mean the Vykkers are working at
the Brewery, nor that they’re being entirely truthful.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> what’s your recipe for your tea , i would love to try it :)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> What you have to do is take some tea, put it in a cup, and Just
Add Water. Normally hot, but you can put in cold water and leave it to
steep and heat in the sun if you want a change. Put in sugar and milk
according to taste. I’m such a pro.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> and the last question is , have you ever been to planet earth before
?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Earth? Isn’t that fictional? It would make no sense for me to
talk about visiting it. Your poor mind must be sick from Brew. Here,
have a lie down and tell me all about. Keep your eyes on the ceiling, I
don’t want you seeing me leave, uh, I mean listen.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> If the roles of Glukkons and Sligs were reversed so that the
Sligs were in charge, how different would Oddworld be? Would Glukkons be
in mechanical pants while the Sligs act snobby in their expensive
suits?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Just how would that happen? Sligs and Glukkons have thousands
of years of biological and societal evolution that have led them to be
who they are today. If all of that were different enough that the
master-servant relationship were reversed, they might as well not be
Sligs and Glukkons anymore. Glukkons are Glukkons because they’re
business gurus; Sligs are Sligs because they’re sadistic peacekeepers.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Oh, and can you tell us about some of the myths in Oddworld that
you’re pretty sure aren’t true?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Molluck is alive, there are living Meeches somewhere, tea is
bad for you. There really are some crackpot ideas floating about.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> And lastly, is there a Glukkon equivalent of SoulStorm Brew that’s
been marketed to that species and others?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> SoulStorm Brew is marketed to everyone! It’s not just Mudokons
that drink it!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> So Alf, if you or Abe could bring someone back from the dead, who
would it be?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> My friend Tobey from RuptureFarms, who took “early retirement”
one day and never came back. Miss you, pal!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hey alf have you ever seen a sea rex

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yes, and it wouldn’t have been the one that got away if it
weren’t for those meddling Scuba Toads! They chased me out of their
pristine waters with their blow darts.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> we havent seen Fleeches since Abe’s Exoddus are they still
around somewhere?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yes, everywhere sewers take them. Horrid things, lurking in the
nastiest, skankiest shadows. Tongues like bullets and guts like a trash
compactor.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Are the Slegs in Stranger’s Wrath feral versions of Slogs?
Like a boar to a pig? Cause they seem only different in color and Slegs
have tusks.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Not feral, completely wild and undomesticable. Just ignore the
bit where the Wolvarks are handling them… I’m pretty sure those were
just Slogs with prosthetics to make them look scarier.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Alf, what happens if all the Gabbits in the egg can
turn out to be all males?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The odds of that happening are one in about a billion billion
billion billion billion. But it were to happen, I dunno, another Last
Can of Gabbiar Auction? It’s statistically more likely someone will find
another tin in the back of their fridge.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why didn’t you guys bring something to drink/eat when you guys
went to Necrum Mines with Abe?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> We didn’t know how long we were going to be! I suppose that’s
no excuse but we were giddy with freedom and well-fed on our arrival at
Monsaic Sanctum. It just never crossed our minds, ok? Sheesh, the number
of people who come and tell me off in retrospect. Where was your
hindsight ahead of time, huh? No? No, you’re not so smart after all.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf, I was wondering… Why was Slig Storm and many other
titles cancelled?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> SligStorm wasn’t so much cancelled as never started or
announced. We only ever really started a couple of projects that we
didn’t see to fruition: Hand of Odd and Fangus Klot.

Hand of Odd fell off our radar as production on Munch progressed. It was
a tortuous and torturous labor for so many reasons, and we ended up in a
position where the only way to deliver a completed game was with an
engine that couldn’t possibly power what we wanted Hand of Odd to be.
There was just no sense in returning to it at the time. But as you
should know, it’s re-entering production soon.

The Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot was simply the project we were working
on when we stopped all internal game development back in 2005. There was
nothing wrong with it, production was going well thanks to the
robustness of the Stranger Engine. We’ve still got all that development
on disc, so we might return to it one day.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> And why is their a movie preview of the movie Abe’s Oddysey on
Youtube? Bye!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It’s just something we threw together a few years ago. Don’t
read too much into it, but we thought it was good and that fans would
like to see it. Didn’t you like seeing it? Oh. Then we’ll just keep
everything to ourselves in the future.

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Hey alf, on my PS box for a two-pack of abe’s oddysee
and abe’s exodus, i saw a picture of a mudokun holding a cooked glukkon
head on a platter. Did you guys actualy eat the poor shmuck, and if so,
how did he taste?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> My friend, you’ve got it all wrong! That’s not the genuine head
of an actual Glukkon! No no no, that would be atrocious behaviour, not
the kind of thing freshly freed slaves should be doing. Our lives are
now dedicated to the persuit of peace and happiness, not cruel and and
violent vengence. Besides, Glukkons taste horrible.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey alf, have those Gabbit eggs hatched yet? Because that was
150 eggs and the. We’d to hatch them soon.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well we haven’t found a can opener yet, so I sure hope they
haven’t hatched. What a horrific way that would be to enter the world!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> sekto has swum (is that even a word) away now, so steefs have no
reason to hide now… right?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sekto may have gone elsewhere for now, but even with the dam
destroyed and the water free, the Mongo River isn’t trouble free. The
valleys are still crawling with Clakkerz, Outlaws and Wolvarks, and the
price of a Steef head remains astronomical. If I were a Steef, I’d still
want to keep my massive head low and not stick my bulging neck out.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Also did he end up giving that idol back to the grubbs, or did he ebay
it or something?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well he got Moolah for it, so I guess he sold it to a Clakker
trader. Grubb artefacts fetch a pretty penny, that’s why you see so many
mines around.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf i was wondering where i would be able to buy some
soulstorm brew from, got a sick party coming up and hoping you could
supply.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sure, just come down to my facility for treating folks addicted
to SoulStorm Brew and I’ll get you the best stuff. Like, real Brew and
everything. No tricksies. Drop on by!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What does it feel like for Abe when a possessed Slig dies?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I asked Abe and he said that it varies. When he gets shot it’s
often a sudden shock, when he falls a long way it’s a horrible sinking
sensation in his stomach. It also depends on how much advanced warning
he gets. If he knows it’s coming he can give himself a couple of minutes
to prepare and not be quite so fazed when he gets back to his own body.
But every single time he does it, he feels guilty for taking the Slig’s
life. Abe knows this kind of stuff has to be done, but he’d prefer to do
it peacefully. Poor guy, I couldn’t stand to have that much on my
conscience.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How do Spoocebows compare to Slig rifles?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well they use renewable resources, aren’t used to subjugate
people, and their trade doesn’t sponsor slavery and oppression, so they
compare favorably in the ethical category.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> So I was wondering, if you had to join one of the
tribe’s which would it be? The Mudomo, The Mudanchee, or the Fleech
tribe? (the name was never given but one of the stinky dead guys had a
specific headdress for the fleeches)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> An interesting question, and for the purpose of giving an
interesting answer I’m going to pretend they’re not all extinct. See now
the Scrab is pretty good at getting things done: he tackles his problems
head-on and doesn’t respond to silly, annoying questions with anything
but a head-lowered, beak-extended charge attack. I like his style. But
Paramites are easier to get along with, and as a fan liaison I need that
image. So I think Mudomo is my answer. I’m not even gonna consider
Fleeches. What’s wrong with you?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Who writes the Daily Deception newspaper?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The Daily Deception staff. They employ the greatest paparazzi,
propagandists, phone hackers and ink slingers to write exactly what will
influence the masses in the way they want. The power of the news is to
grab your attention with provocative headlines, report only what they
want you to know and believe, and pretend anything counter to that
doesn’t exist. I’ve had this argument with Crig too many times.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> do mudokkons have sexual organs

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The queens and the drones do, but not us workers. We don’t need
’em. Too busy working. Now where’s my hackey sack?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Ey there Alf I was just wondering. Why is Abe immune to
soul storm brew sickness

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You didn’t see the state he was in when he got back from
SoulStorm Brewery. Trust me, he might have farted as much of that
badness out as he could Mudokonly manage, but no one drinks Brew and
gets away with it. He spent a long time in my Rehab recuperating, and
I’ve got the boring memories to prove it.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> also how do the glukkons ground up Mudockon bones to a liquid well
Tata

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Excuse me, I need to go and put my head into a bowl for a
while. I’ll be back in time for the next question.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Alf, do Mudokens have second names? If so what’s
yours? If not then what would you like yours to be if you had one?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> If I could have a second name it would have to be some kind of
pun. “Alf Tannin” or “Alf Kettler”. What do you think, folks?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is Sam a monotreme? (Egg-laying mammal)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It doesn’t make a whole heap of sense to use fancy words like
that round these parts. Life on Oddworld evolved on Oddworld, quite
separate from the categories you’re familiar with. Sure there are
resemblances that you’ll recognize, but Mudokons can’t really be
described as mammals. We did, after all, evolve from birds – hence our
feathery hair. But Sam lays eggs, yeah.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How good or bad does Stranger deal with not being able to socialize in
a herd of his own kind?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> If he’s anything like most other species, badly. Mudokons,
Grubbs, Gabbits, Sligs all of us are incredible social. Of course, he
could be like an Elum. Elums get on perfectly well in groups but they
also have no problem being on their own for indefinate stretches. It’s
just another form of their hardiness. Or maybe he’s like a dominant
Scrab and he can’t stand to be with others of his kind. Why are you even
asking me? Go ask him!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf, will you appear more often in the HD remakes ? (that
bottle throwing story sounds awesome ;P)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yeah, I could get some great royalties out of that gig. Good
thinkin’, Boombatmud!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Finally, at the end of AO, there’s a scrab and a paramite beside Abe
and Bigface, why aren’t they attacking muds ?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They’re ceremonial and fully trained to remain calm and still
when presented with large crowds of juicy, tasty, yummy, delicious
Mudokons. Wait, did I just say that? I think I creeped myself out.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 1- Seeing how dangerous the mine car is, who’s suposed to ride it ?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Whoever doesn’t want to be on the receiving end of all that
danger!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2- Is there fleeches in western mudos ?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There are Fleeches everywhere if you know the right places to
look.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 3- Which kind of slig do you fear the most, walking or flying sligs
?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Walking Sligs. Walking Sligs could come at you from any angle.
They could be perched atop a hill or hiding in a hole in the ground.
There’s a nothing you can do to protect yourself from a Slig on foot
except try to dive behind the nearest cover and hope there’s a way out.
Flying Sligs can only come from one direction: up. They’re so noisy you
could hear them descending in a nightclub and you can protect yourself
by simply opening an umbrella. Easy. Don’t know why Abe didn’t think of
it. What a chump.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Could you describe what a slig’s face looks like? It’s cool, I don’t
need to sleep ever again anway. Thanks Alf.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Words cannot describe the horror. Only an ear-piercing scream.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf I got a question for ya! If those bird portals can take
Abe in and out of high security areas then why can’t they just take him
directly to where the mudokens he needs to save, or to a certain glukon
he needs to assassinate are? Often times he seems to need to run/sneak
through lots of annoying sligs and other defenses.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Some reason roads can’t bend and sway to give you a direct
route to your destination. Bird portals are where they are, no matter
how lazy you wanna be!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> alf hello please can you tell us something about squeek

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> His name is Squeek.

<p><b>Question:</b> Where did Squeek get his name from? If you’ve met him
yet \wink\.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oh gee, I dunno, maybe his momma gave it to him.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was just wondering if Squeek’s Oddysee would include the
journey to Ma’Spa or if it would be skipped over? Since there’s been
talk about future plans for Squeek but not Munch’s Exoddus, I was just
curious.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> If I could divine the future, Kyle, I’d be finding out the
upcoming trends in tea consumption and the destined winners of hackey
sack tournaments, not some rubbish about a mythical spawning grounds.
Honestly, do you know whether slapsang or oddlong will be more popular
in three months? No? I’ll go back to reading palms.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will gameplay within the Quintology always include rescuing Mudokons,
etc?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> As long as there are Mudokons to be rescued, I don’t see how it
couldn’t. Unless Abe has a sudden change of heart. Come to think of it,
he has been sporting a pair of very shifty eyes these past few weeks.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf! just wondering if you could answer this question. Who
created the robot Glukkons in Rupture farms on the first game?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I only lived in RuptureFarms from the very moment I hatched
from my egg to the day Abe rescued me 15 years later, so you’ll have to
enlighten me about these robots you’ve been seeing. The only mechanical
creep I remember was the factory Shrink, and you didn’t see him unless
you’d done something majorly wrong. Like that time I filled a vendo with
Meetle Shanks instead of Meep Shavings, and our supervisor Neel got an
allergic reaction from them. Ever seen a tree grow around a cable or a
fence or something? That’s exactly how he swelled up around his mask. It
was disgusting. I have no idea what robot Glukkons you’re thinking of.

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Will you be showing images of the Abe remake on febuary
14th or will you just be telling us some of the details????

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Let’s set things straight: Abe HD was revealed a lot earlier
than we were expecting and while we love that it’s getting so much
coverage and attention, we’re not ready to start talking about it to
press or fans. We know you’re all excited and curious to know what to
expect, but Odd things come to those who Wait! Pour yourselves a tea and
sit back patiently!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I know it’s barely been planned but will the Remake
for SW have any bonus content compared to the original versions? I
wouldn’t mind an extra outlaw.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Stranger’s Wrath will remain exactly the same game but with
much higher quality sound and visuals. However, there may still be bonus
content!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was playing Stranger’s Wrath and I was looking at his
cross-bow and then I thought “How The Hell Does He Fire?” Does he pull
the strings or something?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I imagine all Stranger has to do is glare at those poor
critters on his bow and they’ll hurl themselves away from him as fast as
they can. Thinking about it, Stranger could probably create a powerful
projectile launcher by igniting his halitosis.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Aren’t we a tad overdue for Munche’s latest escapades?
Come on guys, you’re killin’ us over here!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sorry Kene, but Munche is a stubborn Gabbite and just won’t
budge no matter how hard we prod him with a sticke. But I can tell ya
what his future plans are: He’s got his sights set on infiltrating a
textbook factory and learning how to hatch eggs. We’d tell him ourselves
but we’re not even sure we know.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> any word on Hand of Odd? I think this would be a purely
excellent future Oddworld title.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Ideas never go to waste here at Oddworld, and Hand of Odd is
still among the concepts rattling around. The games industry is very
different to what it was a decade ago, and our eventual plans for Hand
of Odd will probably differ accordingly, but for now it’s not something
we’re building.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Can you make the Upgrades for the Natives free?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Whoa, whoa, whoa there! You can’t just go about changing our
ways like that! Native Mudokons don’t use money per se, but nothing in
life is free and military promotions are no exception! Spooce is a big
deal in our society and isn’t going anywhere. That said, Abe does seem
to have bad days and need a lot of it to do some things. I hope he’s not
hooked on the stuff. I’d have to invent a new detox program.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is there ever going to be an Oddworld Movie?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> We’ll always answer yes to this question because it’s one of
our most important goals, but it’s not something we’re working on right
now.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf! Just wanted to ask a question. In AO why is a
mudokon paw on the moon? and why are paramites social, scrabs not?
thanks :)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The Mudokon paw on the moon? Well I’m no shaman but I consider
it an omen that Abe is a pretty determined guy who’s gonna shake those
Glukkons up and get us Muds the freedom we deserve! I could be
completely wrong.

As for Paramites and Scrabs, it’s all a question of perspective. Scrabs
can be social and form huge herds, while separate groups of Paramites
won’t necessarily get along.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Abe’s rocks kicks ass was and still is the king of the
90’s

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Can I get an Amud, brother!! I’ll go tell Abe’s rocks what you
think of them!

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Hey, Alf, newcomer here! Nice place you got here… I
msyelf do not have such a place, but I do have some questions.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Whatever it takes to keep the wind and rain off your head, pal!
I for one could never construct a shelter out of questions, but I could
build a massive fortress outta answers!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Are there still wild Glukkons around?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No way, Glukkons became ‘Civilized’ so many generations back
there’s no chance of any one of them living off the land, let alone a
community of native Gluks. Even if there were, the capitalistic Glukkons
would only respond to their discovery by putting them in a zoo or
something.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is there(or was there ever) a temple dedicated to Meeches?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There were probably dozens of them all across Mudos at some
point, from tiny shrines to towering temple cities. Traditional Mudokon
faiths are so varied but largely forgotten.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is the Almighty Raisin an animal or a vegetable(or something
inbetween)?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Neither. He is a tree. Or he used to be before he shed his
branches and roots. The Almighty Raisin is living proof that “Time makes
fools of us all” is simply untrue.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> And finally, what exactly do Mudokons milk? As in, where does that
milk come from?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Anything we can; Scrabs, Paramites, Elums, they all give milk.
We don’t have a global industry dedicated to milking a single species.
That’s not how to live sustainably with nature.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> In one question you said that Sligs aren’t nice creatures to
hang around with. In another question, you said that you’d give it to a
Slig named Crig. What’s up wit dat?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> All depends on what you’re in to and how you come across. If
you love crude, belittling humor and talking about guns, you’d probably
have a fantastic time in a Slig bar. If you have a more refined sense of
interpersonal communications and don’t want to laugh at the suffering of
others, you’d best steer clear. Crig may be chummy but he’s still a Slig
through and through.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Also, does Crig have a Slog or a Sloggie?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I doubt Crig has any fondness for Slogs after his stint as a
herder in the lonely Mudos mountains. Or maybe he has a very special
fondness for them after their being his only companionship for so many
months. You’d have to ask him, and I haven’t seen him anywhere lately.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> And does Munch still hang out with you, Abe, or anyone else? (Crig
might scare the poor little fella.)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> He sure does. Can’t get rid of the little fella. Not even when
we try really, really hard. Man, I can’t stand the stank of fish. It
makes my tea curdle.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> cool thanks alf and im just wondering how did abe get his
“stich lips” as the other Mudokons would say.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They were sewn on when he was a baby.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> and how did u guys do all the voices for the games?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> We go up to the microphone and read the script. The recording
is then put in the game.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was wondering who dose the artwork for Oddworld Ables oddesy
and exodus. I want to know his or her name and wish to tell him or her
they did a wonderful job. If there is a seprit person for the games
background and main details i want to know who did them. I think the
backgrounds are amazingly beutiful and think people who do artwork need
more credit.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Shucks, Regan, them’s mighty flattering words. Truth is that so
many people contributed to the background artwork that I wouldn’t know
how to begin listing them. There’s the folks who designed every last
machine, path, tree and rock formation, the folks who modelled them in
full 3D and put them together to make the scenes, and the folks who took
the screenshots of those scenes and added details in Photoshop. For
Exoddus we moved more from modelling entire screens to modelling
individual elements and taking a selection of screenshots to reuse
screen after screen.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> But also one other game queston, do muddokoens go to school? Like do
stuff kids do at school? When the muds are only little kids and do they
have parents or dose everyone take care of the babys?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> School?? There ain’t time for school when there’s levers to
pull, walls to wash, bones to mine and bullets to test. Get those silly
notions of homework and hopscotch out of your head and do yer damn job,
ya layabout punk!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> And do you ever help around with the guys on the game? If so what do
you do besides sip tee and awnser are silly questons.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I sure do. Every couple of hours I go on a patrol of the
office, looking over everyone’s shoulders and pointing out the things I
don’t like. But I’m a nice guy, so I like to take any potential sting
out of my comments by voicing them with an air of aloof sarcasm.
Everyone likes sarcasm. It’s like the milk that makes the tea less
bitter.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> If a mudokon was to hand rear a slog as a sloggie, would it
become tame and if not how are they tame to sligs.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Like anything, Slogs are a product of how they’re brought up.
If you raise a Slog with love and care, it’s going to love you back and
look after you and anything you want it to. If you raise it with an iron
fist, it’s going to grow into something aggressive and dangerous, only
cooperating for fear of its own wellbeing. Guess which method Sligs use.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Also if you had a slog do you like it could be tame just giving it a
cup of tea rather then meat all the time or would that kill it? It
wouldn’t be cruel to test to find out as Slogs are cruel to mudokons any
ways and Oddworld doesn’t seem to have any animal welfare laws.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I don’t think Slogs can survive on tea alone, do you?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Also what is Abe’s favorite colour?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Purple.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Sorry if I am being irritaing Alf; it is just I missed you
for the 7 years you were off the net! I got somemore questions in lieu
of my costume!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No way was it seven years. You’re hyperboling, buster! But I
missed you too.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 1.) What is the relationship between Interns and Sligs? Do they think
the ‘grass is greener’ working with the Glukkons and Vykkers
respectively?

2.) Why don’t for that matter Glukkons use Interns and Vykkers
Sligs?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They’re perfectly suited to their respective masters. Glukkons
know that guns, pants and smokes are all it takes to make a Slig loyal
for life, and Interns love having access to needles and drugs. They
don’t think highly of each other. Show me two demographics that do.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 3.) Are Interns asexual or not? Do they have a queen? (Queen
Ingrid?)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Tell you what, make friends with one and give it their
favourite grunge hop hip trop album, or whatever it is they listen to,
for their birthday. Once you have their trust, invite them to the local
milkshake salon (they can fit the straws between their mouth stitches)
and see how far you get. And never, ever, under any circumstances inform
me of your discoveries.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 4.) Where did Doc come from? Vykkers Lab or elsewhere?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Considering Vykkers Labs smashed into the ground in a million
pyrotechnic pieces, no, I don’t think Doc came from there.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 5.) Are they three main races on Oddworld? Industrial, Native and
Consumer, which includes Clakkerz and Outlaws? Or do they belong to one
of the established two?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Industrial, Native and Wildlife have been pretty useful classes
so far, but there are always exceptions. Gabbits, for instance, can fit
into either Native or Wildlife depending on what criteria you think are
most important; they have language and other social intelligence, but no
architecture or art or technology. We put Clakkerz in the ‘Settler’
category, and Outlaws in the ‘Outlaw’ category. In time our
understanding of these categories and how they interact and overlap with
others may come to grow substantially.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 6.) Why does only Sekto have Wolvarks? Where did they come from? Do
they have a queen?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There are many competing security companies on Oddworld,
including Sligs and Wolvarks. Glukkons go with Sligs, Sekto goes with
Wolvarks. It’s consumer choice!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 1. dont know if u have seen munch or a gabbit b4 but how do
they talk? they never use their tounge and hav got not very many teeth
and their teeth r small

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Gabbits have fantastically versatile tongues that put yours and
mine to shame, and can produce a massive range of vocalizations that let
them immitate the languages of dozens of species. Conversely, they do
have trouble with dental consonants for reasons you’ve already
explained.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2. wat do khanzumers look like? the guys that the glukkons make their
products for

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I haven’t met them yet, but the Glukkons say they’re the most
important people on the planet. They give them all the choices, all the
luxuries, all the commoddities. I can only imagine they’re hereditarily
rich beyond anyone’s wildest dreams, capable of funding the most
important research AND buying a fleet of the fanciest of yachts, all
from a single bank note, with enough change left over to melt down into
crowns.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hello Alf, I was wondering a few things: Between Glukkons,
Gloktogi and Oktigi, which species has the longest natural lifespan and
which has the shortest?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Gloktigi have the shortest lifespan, at an average of 40 years.
Glukkons have an average lifespan of 65 years. I’m not convinced Oktigi
ever die.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> And, what do (or atleast would) Clakkerz think about Mudokons, what do
Mudokons think about Grubbs, and what do Grubbs think about Vykkerz?
Thanks.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Why don’t you go and ask them?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> also most people i know dont know the awsomeness of oddworld games so
i try to show them but still nothing they said it would be a stupid
game, so im acualy not there freinds any more because they made fun of
your games.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hey dude, that’s really sweet of you to say and all, but don’t
judge people just because of their personal taste in pop culture. It
takes all sorts, you know? I don’t ignore Abe just because he likes
jacks and I like hacky sack. Hmm, I wonder if there could be a song in
that.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hello Alf! I have a couple questions…

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Where was I on the night of that thing that happened?! Uh, I
was, uh, washing my ponytail. In that river. That’s miles away. Hmm? Not
those kinds of questions? Oh, then you may proceed.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 1. If there’s a mudokon queen, would there be like mudokon Queenlings
(Younger Mudokon Queens)? How would they look like? That is if the
vykkers keeping Sam captive and carefully watching over the eggs made a
slip up and let an egg holding a Queenling pass through their
security…

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well sure, I mean everything’s got to die at some point, right?
Even Oktigi, I guess. And if the sole reproductive member of your
species dies, you’ll really hope there were someone to take her place.
So I guess there must be Queenlings, or maybe they’re called Princesses.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2. Alf, I have a question about a variation of the spooceshrub. In the
old Munch’s Oddysee visualizations, there were rainmakers with these
pink spooceshrubs around the edges called Humshrubs. How much more
diffrent are they from Spooceshrubs? What do they have to offer? And
more importantly… are they Tasty?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Great Mother Odd gifted nature with more plants than you can
shake a Stockyard at. The wisest shamans know which ones can be used to
cure which ailments, and the specific rituals that have to be followed
for them to work. SpooceShrubs, HumShrubs, BuzzShrubs, Popberries,
they’re just the tiniest sampling of the rich floral medicine cabinet of
nature. Woe betide the unscrupulous forces that would love to get their
hands on such ancient knowledge, and even more woe betide those that
fall victim to that power.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 3. Here’s my last question, are there any subspecies on Oddworld? Like
a variation of Grubbb or Mudokon specifcally? Perhaps any hybrids?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well sure, any species distributed across enough natural
environmental variation is going to produce significant variation in
their genetics. Grubbs and Mudokons aren’t anywhere near evolutionarily
related, you’re not going to see hybrids. For two species to cross-breed
they’d need to be closely related, like Oktigi and Glukkons.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Thank you for your time Alf, I hope to see my questions in the next
batch of Dear Alf on the website

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Here’s hoping I can re-establish a regular routine for them,
aye?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Could you describe what Scrab and meech look
like from birth?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No, it took me some time to learn how to communicate with
words, and even gestures. I wasn’t even born with the knowledge of what
Scrabs and Meeches look like.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Have you heard of or seen any cross species in Oddword during your
life?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> What’s all the interest in cross-breeding all of a sudden?
Well, since you ask, Gloktigi are a cross between Glukkons and Oktigi.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I love your cocky attitude.

Abe = way too shy

Bigface = boring know-it-all

Alf= Smart and K-W-L…Yes I can’t spell…..

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hey, those are my brothers you’re talking about! Don’t be so
mean, you stinky turd!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf in oddworld do mudos use any spiritual healing stuff
like crystals or reiki healing or meditation?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Mudokon mystic culture is full of crystals and meditation,
along with other spiritual objects and practices. I don’t know about
reiki healing, I guess there could have been tribes that practised that.
You have to understand that a lot of our ancient knowledge has been lost
and forgotten.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> and are any mudos psychic?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Have you met Abe?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> i was just wondering how did abe get his mystical powers and
can other mudokons learn it?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Magic is like art or sport or logic: some people have it, some
don’t. Some people are so bad they can’t be taught no matter how hard
you try. Others are so good they can’t stop even if they want to. Abe
has a lot of natural, latent mental powers that makes it easy for him to
do this fancy pants stuff like possession, and you can sure bet it makes
a lot of people jealous. Possession in particular should take decades of
dedicated practise to pull off. But then it’s not like Abe asked for
this gig anyway, so we can’t keep getting angry at him and filling his
bed with crushed egg shells.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 1- If Abe can control bells and farts, why can’t he control
slogs, elums, fleeches or idk… mine carts ?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well first of all, he can possess Slogs. For all I know he can
possess Fleeches by now, too. Why would he even need to possess an Elum?
And possessing minecarts… you’ve got an overactive imagination, son.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2- Can you transform into Shrykull too ?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No, I’ve never completed the Temple Trials. I don’t need
arduous treks and certain death to prove how awesome I am to anyone.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> So, Alf, tell me the story behind Shrykull. Is there a
scripture? Mythology? Legends and whatnot?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sure, there’s heaps of that stuff. It evolves across time and
space, too. Everyone’s got their own interpretations and uses of a god.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Are there other deities that you guys worship, or is Shrykull the one
supreme god?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There are more Mudokon gods than there are Mudokon tribes, but
not all of them are practical to Abe. No point praying for a bountiful
harvest when you’re infiltrating a meat processing plant.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Are mudokons the only ones to use PSI, or psychic powers? If
not, who are they?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Mudokons aren’t the only peoples to make use of magic. Not
every part of Oddworld has magic, and not every culture uses the same
kind of magic.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 1. Some questions about Abe’s possession abilities: How did Abe
suddenly become capable of possessing Paramites and Scrabs in AE?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Abe’s powers grow over time as he becomes more adept at them.
Have you never been unable to complete that certain level no matter how
hard you try, but then one day you do it and it’s no longer a problem
for you and you do it all the time? Oh man, I love that feeling.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why can’t he possess some other creatures such as Slogs?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Abe can possess Slogs.
</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> Why some creatures explode after being possessed while others don’t?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It’s a combination of what Abe wants to happen to them, and the
creature’s mental state. Certainly Abe doesn’t want to hurt the
innocent, sacred beasts of Oddworld. He usually doesn’t want to go
around killing Sligs, but Abe recognizes that needs must.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why do Scrabs and Paramites freeze when Abe chant?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Because they don’t like it.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Abe’s possession power changed in MO; its range is different and
requires a direct path to the traget; is there a story behind this
change?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yes, the Shaman does tell you. I can understand not paying
attention to that guy, but you need to listen to your elders, chump!
Raisin granted Abe the ability to possess his enemies from afar. No
longer does Abe’s chant give him control of whatever the nearest thing
to him is, it gives him control over whoever he chooses!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> alf according to the quintology their could be five moons i
have a feeling in a future game stranger will get his own moon and the
original game sligstorm the sligs could also have theirown moon how
would you react.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oddworld has dozens of moons, but we can’t just dedicate each
one to a different species because you’ll so quickly run out. Besides,
what would you do with all the moonrocks you carve out of the surface?
You could probably make a few extra moons with it all.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2. These birds from the bird portals are pretty much everywhere, but
what are they exactly? They’re never actually spoken of. What are they
exactly? What’s the story behind them? How are they related to
Mudokons?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They’re birds. Birds are everywhere.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Sup’ Alf, I’ve been a fan of Oddworld games since I was 4, and
I’ve always wondered what the Colas taste like, I’m sure you might of
answered this before, but I’m too much of a schmuck to check and see if
you did. Anyways, can you ask Abe what the colas taste like? Are they
different flavors, are they super carbonated? I’ve always wondered about
them.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Uhhh, I don’t remember any carbonated drinks. Cola? I dunno.
Did Abe ever take down a Gluka Cola bottling plant? I really must start
keeping a diary of this stuff.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf: After playing through all of the Oddworld
exploits, one question springs to mind…

Why doesn’t anyone try using the Industrialist’s guns against them?

I mean sure, Stranger greatly dislikes them and Munch can control
basic machines, but why doesnt Abe or any of the other Mudokons pick up
a Slig’s rifle and use it?

It can’t be that hard to use if a Slig can figure it out, and it has
got to be better than a warclub or a Spoocebow.

An army of well armed Mudokons would be better than one guy possessing
some rent-a-cop.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Probably folks have tried, but let’s face it, we’d then be
battling them on their terms. Their weapons are designed for their
hands, not ours. Sligs might not receive mandatory training but most
have spent years handling guns. And if we rely on ours, then our triumph
over slavery is itself dependent on the Industrialists. And we don’t
really want to make use of the same things that have been used to
subjegate us for so many years.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Alf, is there a reason Big Face wears that big mask? If you
ask me, it seems like a liability, since he can’t bend over without
impaling himself.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It’s ok, Big Face hasn’t taken off his sandals to clean his
feet in years. Rest assured he’s unlikely to injure himself with his
own ceremonial accessories.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hey alf i gotta good question for ya! abe got his fourth finger
cut off right? and in the HD picture he has 4 fingers i would like for
you to explain how he got another finger.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I don’t understand what you mean. Abe has four fingers and
always has. You must be tripping out on something bad.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Gee, i sure love these mudokkon pops, but i wonder what is
inside them. So since you mudokkons make them, what is the secret recipe
in them that makes them so darn good?????????????????

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> OH ODD OH ODD OH ODD NOOOOOOO

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: From a design perspective, for the Sligs mouth, and more
relevant, the Paramites mouth – was the human hand used as inspiration?
I don’t know if thats already been mentioned but a Paramites mouth has
an uncanny resemblance to an open hand (with the thumb moved under the
four fingers). Would this also have been done to make more of a human
connection, rather than the creature looking completely alien. This way
theres a bridges connection.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> All Oddworld characters are designed with real anatomy in mind.
They all have skeletons, musculature, brains and digestive systems.
However, I don’t think having a human hand for a face makes anyone
appear less alien.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey,Alf!I wonder what languages do you speak on
Oddworld.Is there one language for all or one for Mudokons,other for
Glukkons. Do the sound that sligs make have a meaning for them?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oddworld is full of languages! Before faster forms of transport
were created, different races and tribes would have their own languages,
but the need for efficient BusinessSpeak weeds out the smaller and more
unique dialects. Native races have mostly forgotten their ancient,
musical tongues, but just as with other old arts, they’re preserved by
wise shamans who recognize the value of cultural knowledge. Sligs won’t
have any more of a clue to their linguistic heritage than anyone else.
The noises they make are probably just crude emotive sounds.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> have any mudokons ever eaten a mudokon pop and not realised
because how can they not realise when its your head on a stick?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Funnily enough, I never did add this question to the
application form for fresh rehabitants. Buddy advised that we’re trying
to make those lost souls feel better, not more suicidal.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> do mudokons live in fear of slogs all the time, also can they tame
them coz alot of muds just seem to sit on their back sides while ab does
all the adventures, you do all the writing and have your own rehab and
tea centre, it would be nice to see a mud doing domethibg with them
selves and try the hobbie of slog whispering.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Write me again once you’ve mastered lion taming and I’ll
introduce you to a few of my animal handler pals. Actually, that’s
unfair. Lions are smart.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> quick question do you think Big face would do a tattoo
for me? just like Abe?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Big Face would be absolutely delighted to bestow with whatever
awesome skinart your heart desires. I’ve scheduled you for an
appointment in the deepest, darkest depths of the Paramonian Temple. We
expect you to find your own way there.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Have you ever got sick from a fart??

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, this one time I was stuck in a lift…
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Have you ever had to stay home from school cause you got a low
gamerscore?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> School?? The only education we got was being brutally beaten
for not exceeding our own capabilities! We learnt quickly, and we
remember those lessons for life. School! You kids just don’t know what
you’ve got.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I’d like to know how a mudokon skin feels like. Maybe i can hug
them in a dream someday. I’ve heard Mudokons are like chameleons. So, is
your tongue as long as theirs? And if you are a raptile, you’ll need a
lot of sun to keep your body warm. But i wonder if muds are cold or warm
blooded.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I know Muds who’ve worked in mines their whole life, never ever
seeing the sky. That makes me think we’re warm-blooded. Thus, you can
hug us and you won’t get cold. But I dread think why you want to know
about the length of our tongues, so I’ll leave it at that.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> OK, what I wana know is why whenever Abe or Munch (or
anyone I toss of a cliff) never gets injured for the fall and if this
also related to the vykkers.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Have you ever considered that we’re all just an inch or so
tall, and so our terminal velocity is never big enough for us to get
hurt from falls? Or that on a hot day, soils and metal become very
elastic and sproingy? Or that due to Oddworld being completely hollow,
there is no gravity, and the only thing causing us to accelerate towards
the ground is the Vykkers blowing downwards from their flying labs? You
haven’t? Then I’d say you don’t need to stay at my rehab.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 1. Seeing as how you’re a tea brewer, drinker and distributor, I was
curious if you knew about \[brand name censored\]. The stuff tastes
great and goes down easy.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Dear Company Representative, thank you for your question. I
look forward to the large amount of free samples you will be sending to
my address. Other varieties of commercial tea are available.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2. It seems pretty obvious that from now on, Abe and Munch will need
to work together until both of their goals are completed. Are there any
new prospective allies for them?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oddworld is filled with tragic victims. Some of them must
surely also be heroes, and in time I’d wager their paths will cross.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 3. Finally, was the Rupture Farms that you and Abe came from just a
franchise offshoot or was it the original RuptureFarms i.e. the
headquarters of the whole brand?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I’ve seen the RuptureFarms logo on discarded litter since we
shut the factory down, so the company is presumably still out there
somewhere. However, I haven’t found a larger meat packaging plant. Have
you?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Thanks a bunch and I hope that your tea shop has some good books to
read while relaxing with the steamy goodness.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I tried putting out books and magazines for folks to read, but
there were cup stains all over them by the end of the first week.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I heard from some Clakkerz that Xplosives McGee was raised by
Wolvarks. Do they look after young Outlaws often?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> A baby that’s “looked after” doesn’t tend to become the
ringleader of a violent criminal organization, but I suppose it all
comes down to perspective. As in “You’re trusting what gossip idle
townsfolk can come up with? Get some perspective!”
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> And, were Outlaws always they way we’ve seen them? Or did they end up
that way?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You do have to wonder what it would take to transform a species
into a violent, sadistic, paranoid gang of greedy cut-throats who’ll do
whatever it takes to cling to their little domain. Somehow I suspect
it’s more than simple outback survival, but I’m not going to be the one
to go up to them and ask.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I heard that Mudokon flakes don’t get along to well with
Mudokon natives. If this were true, then what do Mudokon Scrubs do when
they’re freed? Do Mudokon shamans make them go through some sort of
ritual or something?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There’ll always be clashes between city dwellers and rural
folks, especially if they’re forced to start sharing everything. Imagine
if you grew up surrounded by entertainment on demand on addictive
consumer products, then had to give that all up to adopt round-the-clock
hard labor just to ensure the next week’s food. Culture shock and
withdrawl are not a good combination. In conclusion, I’m sure everything
fine and there’s nothing we need to worry about.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> How close are you and Abe? Do you see him much?
Where does he live…

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Abe and I are firm friends, and if he ever needs my help I’ll
give Buddy the keys to the Rehab and join him on his next adventure.
It’s just sometimes a little advance warning would be appreciated,
y’know? Abe has his own hut where he tries to relax, but that’s not easy
when your entire race, alive and dead, are visiting you for advice,
favours and worship.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hey alf do you have any pet slogs?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> oh and why do you guys have pony tails?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> So our hair doesn’t get caught in heavy machinery.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Which Mudoken are you in Abe’s Oddysee?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I honestly can’t remember. The one with the fez?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> And do you still get people coming into Rehab?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> And asking questions that don’t serve any purpose? You’d better
believe it.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Does Munch have a speech impediment, or did all Gabbits
talk that way?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Munch is only young. He was born far away from other cultures,
and he’s been entirely without any socializing for almost longer than he
can remember. And he’s got a mouth wider than a queen’s abdomen. Cut the
cute little fishie thing some slack!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I like to think like a scientist, and for the longest time I
have pondered this, how does a Glukkon put on their clothes? Certainly
their anatomic structure would make it rather difficult, if not
seemingly impossible, having to use their arms to support themselves. I
had attempted to experiment this by trying my hardest to stand on my own
hands while trying to put on a one piece suit, and besides constantly
losing my balance and falling over in pain, I had gotten a headache as I
tried to figure out what to do from there. My only other guess is that
they use servants or specialized machines to dress them, which wouldn’t
surprise me if that was the case. But I gotta know, for the good of
science!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Dear Dr. Jerk, many congratulations on having the decency to
perform experiments on yourself instead of on little cutsie balls of
fuzz. But science is based on observation, and if you haven’t observed
the Glukkons during their daily routine, then your experiments prove
little. Maybe if you could hack into security cams you’d be able to see
what kind of slaves the Glukkons have to dress them. And presumably wash
them. And who knows what else.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> If nearly all of the major races on Oddworld have a Queen, then do the
Gabbits also have a Queen?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> If they did, they don’t any more.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> it occurred to me that we’ve never really heard the history or
story of the Meeches. Whilst obviously tasty, what was their deal? Did
Mudokans get on with them, or were they the sort of Paramite/Scrab blend
of viciousness we have come to avoid? And most importantly, what did
they sound like?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Meeches were definitely on par with Paramites and Scrabs in
terms of deadliness, although what they lacked in cunning tricksiness
and sheer badassery they made for in brute number. What did they sound
like? They sounded hungry.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do mudokons have nostrils? If so, where are they?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Of course Mudokons have nostrils, you bizarre thing. How do you
think we smell?!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> First things first, besides you, Abe, and… well, your entire
mudokon race, let’s say, has there ever been anyone else trying to stop
the devious schemes of those greedy glukkons elsewhere that you may have
heard of… besides Crunch. Sorry if I got his name wrong, it’s been some
time since I last heard his name. Also… call me a little off- the-rocker
if you want, but… think they’ll ever be a GOOD glukkon? (I’m sure all of
us doubt that’ll happen at anytime, but one can always hope, right?)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There have been conflicts between natives and industrial forces
for as long as there’s been corporate takeover and destruction of the
land. Any number of brave individuals have fought for their freedom, but
it’s only now that we have a broader idea of the scale of the problem,
an understanding of what’s at stake, and insider knowledge from escaped
slaves that we can really start packing a punch.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why does Stranger talk to himself so often? I would ask
him directly but he scares me a bit..

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I need to find someone who can screen these questions for me.
Then I might be able to get some things done around here, like that
kitchen remodelling I keep promising myself. I sure could use an
omlette. I might make one after I’ve had a shower. I suppose I should
finish with these questions first.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> You say Oddworld’s time and Earth’s time cannot be compared, right?
Then why did Stranger only have (If I recall correctly) 3:30 Earth
minutes to get up to Sekto’s office? Maybe we are connected physically
after all?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Because players would be a bit confused if we forced them to
finish the level in 39:83 blipblops or whatever. Hey, what is our unit
of measuring time anyway? Sektonds? Hahahahaha! Paraminutes? Hahah, oh
boy, that’s a zigger!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Also, where did you really get your Fez from? At first you told us you
found it.. but then later you said you bought it.. Seems awfully
suspicious..

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Actually I made it by crushing up red berries to make a dye in
which I soaked a fabric I fashioned out of various plant fibres. After
that, I papier-mâchéd the wet material over a small tree stump and let
it harden. The tassel is a knot of matted Fuzzle fur I collected from
those plants with little hooky bits. I platted it and attached it with
guano. What do you mean, you don’t believe me?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Throughout the series of oddworld, i have noticed that all
mudokons are wrinkley, blood-shot eyed, and noticably underweight. Are
mudokons all malnourished and ill, or is it natural for them to look
like this?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Throughout my time as Question-Answerer Supremo, I have noticed
that all fans are pasty-skinned, greasy-haired, and cheese
snack-stained. Have you all got nothing better to ask me, or is this
simply an unavoidable phenomenon for someone in my position?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hey Alf! i have a two part question for you; do Mudokons
get along with native sligs? and if so, would Mudokons be willing to get
along with sligs who have escaped the Glukkon-run industrial world to
return to more native practices?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> What native Sligs? Have you been on the popberries again?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> As a fellow Oddworld fan, I, like many die-hard fans, am wondering
how long until Citizen Seiege it out?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Citizen Siege is a property we put a lot of work and effort
into, but which we’re not working on right now. Thanks to various
economic occurences that took place over the last few years,
distributors are now more cautious than ever when it comes to bold,
unproven ideas for undemonstrated (though, we’re certain, existant)
audiences. In a business sense, now is not the time for us to be
focusing on Citizen Siege.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> After that, will they make Oddworld related movies? I would love to
see you and Abe on the big screen.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Who’s “they”? The Sligs’ mothers? And yes, we’ve always wanted
to make Oddworld movies, but for the same reasons as above, that’s not
likely to be happening in the forseeable future.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Are you going to be starring in the next Oddworld game?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> If you are referring to our upcoming title Oddworld: Alf’s
Awesome, then I’m afraid I’m not allowed to reveal just how awesome it
will be to have star in it.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I love your fez, but I was wondering if it
came in different colors like you Muds? :)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> What kind of fez isn’t red??

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Is there any news as to whether or not Oddworld
Stranger’s Wrath will become backward compatible on the Xbox 360
sometime soon?? I just got it for £3.50 and have been dying to play
it!!!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> That’s entirely up to Microsoft, and as I understand it they’re
not releasing any more backward compatibility patches. You can, of
course, purchase the game on the delightful Steam platform! The benefit
of this is that you’re giving your Moolah to us to make more games,
instead of to some reseller who’ll probably just use it to chop down
forests and stamp on Fuzzles.

<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf! Hope ya don’t mind me asking but … what ever
happened to Squeek?…

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Squeek? Huh, you’d think I’d remember a name like that, but I
can’t say I’ve ever met a fellow going by that moniker. Are you sure you
haven’t been at the Brew? Because I know a little place that can help
you with that…
</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> Is the Oddworld game “The Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot” still
gonna happen?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well it’s nice of you to trust my predictions of the future but
you really have to go see the Raisin if you want that kind of knowledge,
and I doubt he’d ever give it to you straight. Expect riddling,
misdirection and snoring, and that’s even if you can stand the stench
and squirming of all the Rats. It gives even ol’ Alf the heebies. Oh,
and I can’t tell you where to find him, his lair is a well-hidden cave,
its location a well-guarded secret. Good luck!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Yo Alf…I got Another Question for ya. So i Know spooce is a BIG
thing in abe so you wont take it off.(I’m fine with that). So here it
is. Will all your game’s now be 3D platformers instead of 2D? Will Abe
be in any new games? Will you make any new games? And will the Spooce
Archer be back?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> We’ve never considered ourselves bound by any single genre
before, and we’re not going to start now. Abe might be back in new
games, but since we haven’t announced any it’s impossible to say. The
Spooce Archers is still broadcast daily on Radio Spore.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 1. For creatures of Oddworld such as Paramites and Scrabs,
what was the design process behind the creation of them? e.g animal’s
reference and initial ideas etc.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yes, we did use animal reference and initial ideas.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2. Will you consider adding characters in future games that couldn’t
make the cut in previous titles? Such as Luskan Marauder and the Sea
Rex.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sure! We broke our backs designing these things for a reason:
to be seen!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 3. Munch’s Oddysee had it’s problems during production. The serious
nature of the previous Oddworld titles seemed somewhat lost. Would you
ever consider remaking the game, the way you originally intended it to
be?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Munch will take exception to that. Why do you want to make him
go through all that again? Don’t you think the poor lil’ fella’s been
through enough as it is??
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> If all Mudokons are related in one way or another, why
are you considered Abe’s best friend?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sounds like you don’t get on with your family too well, but I
assure you that brothers can be buddies. Besides, don’t they teach you
about evolution at school? We’re all related in one way or
another!

</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Would you please tell me more about the atmosphere on
Oddworld?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The atmosphere on Oddworld is one of contrasts and conflict,
but look underneath all that and you’ll find beautiful cultures and
landscapes. Nah, I’m just teasing you. I know what you mean! Gotta say I
don’t really know much about the atmosphere apart from it helps with the
old breathing malarkey. It’s normally see-through, which is handy. Other
times it’s not, either because of factories polluting nature or, well,
do you have ‘sprouts’ where you come from?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf! I was just wondering something about you muds, is
that hair on your head or a tentacle? Also, glukkons can suck it.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Now why, oh why, would you want Glukkons to suck our
ponytails?! That’s just… that’s just creepy! Urgh. I’m going to have
nightmares now. Thanks a lot, pal.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will we ever find out what happened to the other Slig Queens
besides Skillya? Or more info about her in general. Also will we be
seeing baby Mudokons or how they are raised?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yes. Probably. I mean, to suggest otherwise would be to imply
that time on Oddworld had frozen! And that’s the nonsense talk of a
Brew-addled mind, which, since you want to see a Slig queen, I can
only conclude you are.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will Crig the Slig be making a come back?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It’s hard to say. Clampdowns on Slig whistleblowing have made
it hard for him to answer even trivial questions in public. But if Abe
can get away with tweeting on his iFone without management finding out,
then anything’s possible.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Iv got three questions

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You’ve sent them to the right Mud!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 1) How are mudokons born? We have seen eggs and obviously adult
mudokons, but never a baby or a female mudokon.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The babies come from the eggs and turn into the adults. If I
have to draw a diagram to teach you where eggs come from, then I’m just
not going to bother.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2) How did Glukons get to where they are with no arms?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Conniving and flunkies!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 3) Any chance on a sale for the Artbook or possible a updated one?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You’d have to speak to Ballistic about that first thing. An
updated art book? Sure, I’ll just get out my crayons and Elum-hair
brushes. Which berries do I mix to make cobalt?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf! I was wondering, how do the different vending machines
in Munch’s Oddysee work? How to the drinks make Abe and Much invisible?
Was it the Vykkers?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Vendos work by being covered in flashy cartoon ads and located
everywhere you turn, and you’ll find them stocked full of products by
all sorts of industrial families. Those with bizarre side-effects do
tend to be made by the Vykkers. Don’t ask me how Invisible works, but
there’s almost certainly an expensive “Visible” sold by guess-who.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Anyway, my second (or probably fourth if you count all those other
extra ones) was what ever happened to Mullock? I know it’s a little
cliche, but was he ever found?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> If Molluck knows what’s good for him, he’ll have died in the
wreckage of RuptureFarms.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will you guys port the Oddboxx to Mac? I’d really appreciate not
having to open up VMWare Fusion to play games, as it chews up my Macbook
Pro’s battery!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> We’re looking into it but we’re making no promises.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi this question is for Alf, why does Munch get his own
moon when he is the only member of his species that is still alive
besides the gabbit eggs and does this mean that if there is one meech
alive does that meech get his own moon????

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Home time!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div><h2><a id="dear-alf-march-2011-volume-2"></a>dear-alf-march-2011-volume-2<br>(Posted on: 03/2011)</h2><center><a href="#toc">Back to the top</a></center><br>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: 1. How are you, how it feels to be finally back?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It’s amazing! I haven’t had an outlet for my sadism like this
in years!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2. I was always wondering, ever since I played first Oddworld game
back in 1997… Where is this whole Oddworld thing happening? I mean is it
an alternate universe, or a long time ago in a galaxy far far away,
maybe a distant future, or is it our times just a different
planet/galaxy? :)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oddworld is Oddworld. Questions about galaxies and universes
and futures and pasts and realities… it all distracts from the here and
now! Don’t you think so?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> In your last entry on the old website, you said Mud’s didn’t
have tear ducks, even though in AE they were using Mudokon tears……. did
the mud’s lose them after being put on the Tear Tractors?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I did not say that! On the contrary, as I recall, I was
actually saying I myself had shed tears of admiration. Just because we
lost a finger, doesn’t mean we’re going to keep collectively losing body
parts until there’s nothing left. Not unless Abe starts leading us into
mines and off cliffs, and I know he’d never do that.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey, Alf! I have a few questions i hope you can answer for
me. When did the mudokins start to worship The Almighty Raisin; what
happened to Bigface?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Big Face is still helping the Mudokon resistance, but the
Raisin is millennia old and can foresee the future. Can’t you see how
that might be more beneficial to our heroes?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> About how many moons does Oddworld have?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Air and light pollution in this region makes it hard for me to
view a clear night sky, but I’d say there are at least five.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why is Abe a blue mudokin and not green, like most of them?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Some TV production company visited RuptureFarms offering us
makeovers to be broadcast all over Mudos at prime time. We all thought
it was another invasive and meaningless distraction for the
entertainment-addicted masses and didn’t want to get involved, but Abe
fell for it completely. He got the lip piercings, the yellow contacts
and, yes, the all-over blue tan. He’s such a sucker.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What ever happened to Abe’s Mother?(i thought there was supposed to be
somthing about that in Munch’s Oddysee!) Thanks, and I hope you can
answer sme of these questions without getting to perplexed!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> He was going to become her registered carer, but when Munch
showed up he changed his mind and shoved her out of sight in the Nolybab
Retirement Home. I take her to bingo every couple of weeks.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Have Muds and steefs ever worked with each other before  
If not I think it would be really cool if Abe and stranger meet up to go
on an adventure with munch or something like that

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I once asked Stranger if he could give me a lift to work but he
blew me off with some excuse about not going my way. Next morning as I’m
waiting for the bus in the rain, he drives past through a puddle and
drenches me from ponytail to pinky toe. Screw that selfish schmuck!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Can you tell me if these are coming back in any of the
new Oddworld games? Abe, Munch, Sligs, Glukkons, Mudokons, Vykkers,
Paramites, Scrabs, You, Interns, Fuzzles and are the Chroniclers (An
enemy which was meant to be in the PS2 version of Munch’s Oddysee, I
believe.) going to appear?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No, I can’t tell you that.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, Could you tell us a little about Sqeek, like what
race is he, etc. If its not to much to ask. :)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, Squeek likes long walks on the promenade and watching the
sway of tall grass. I’m glad that this answer satisfies you and everyone
else wondering about Squeek! Now I won’t ever be asked about Squeek
again!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What is -to your knowledge – the largest factory that is
currently still functioning on Oddworld?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sheesh, can’t really help you with that question. Every factory
I’ve heard of has been blown up or bankrupt… for some reason.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf I was just wondring, In Abes Exodus there is a closed
door that has the Vykkers Labs logo on it so I am just guessing that the
door took you to Vykkers Labs and if it did how could it when Vykkers
Labs floats in the sky???, is that true or was it ment to just show the
players that Vykkers Labs will be the setting of the next game??? Thanks
you for your time

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well it certainly couldn’t take you directly to Vykkers Labs
because, as you say, Vykkers Labs floats in the sky. You’re right,
that’s a little bit strange and you have piqued my curiosity. Let me
know what you find when you go through the door yourself, won’t you!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> phleg at the boneworkz gets killed when abe possesses him
to engage “OPERATION LIGHTNING BOLT” but at the end, he goes “i hate
that guy” (dunno what part it was, i just remember it well) so what
happened to him huh? was it his bro saying that or phleg him self? if
this question confuses you im sorry, french lingo is invading my mind
and i am forced to eat snails with frog legs and strong chesses.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Inspired by your astute observation, I made sure I had a large
supply of cheesey potato snacks, put on my finest tinfoil hat, and sat
down to replay the events of the SoulStorm Brewery atrocity. And you
know what? After three days I still couldn’t see Director Phleg saying
those words. Maybe I’m just not as hork-eyed as you, or maybe I haven’t
been playing enough chesses, but I think you’re imagining it.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> This has been on my mind for a while: I assume that
paramites, fleeches, and scrabs don’t have eyes. If so, how does
invisibility keep Abe from being killed by them?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hint: Don’t go to a Vykkers asking this, or anything, unless
you carry considerable diplomatic immunity. I think I can remember it
cropping up on the Oddworld Nature Channel. Something about magnets?
Maybe if we could understand a broader range of sensory perceptions than
those we’re born with, we could transcend to ahigher level of
consciousness. Then again, I need to spend today collecting firewood.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2. Whose are these ribs? For Meech? This rib are very big.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Look, I’ve been in disturbingly close contact with quite enough
bones for one lifetime, thank you very much. You’ll forgive me for
skipping over these questions.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hi alf, im prof yogert and im here to ask some
questions

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Mmm, yoghurt…
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> first of all, what is you rank in oddworld(leach,slave,greater,slog,slig,intern,gluken,mulluk)?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Uh, Mudokon?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2 were did you get that cool fez?, i want it so bad

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It’s a genuine Harmani that fell out of a FeeCo Train. You’re
not having it!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 3 is it possible for me to help you answer questions?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> First my clothing, now my occupation! You need to go and carve
your own niche in society, bud! Ain’t enough room in these parts for two
Alfs. Or should that be Alves?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> and last of all, when was your last soulstorm? mine was 11 years ago just before it get blown up thanks for your time pleaze stay odd this time lol:)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> And now you’re eyeing up my weaknesses! Keep away from me!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b>  There are troublesome arguments around the web about
whether Stranger’s Wrath is the third game in the Oddworld Pentalogy or
not. Can you bring some light into this matter?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I don’t know what this Pentalogy is you’re speaking of. Hang
on, let me get the project handbook out… let’s see… hmmm, nope. Nothing
in here under that name. You must be thinking of something else:
Stranger’s Wrath is certainly not part of any ‘Pentalogy’.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Whats your opinion about Formspring and those ask-o-matic webpages?
Won’t you like Dear Alf on those things?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Good thinking, Boombatman! I have genuinely considered it, but
my first love are these monthly columns. Web 2.0 has made it very easy
to stay in regular touch with the fans, excitingly so, but I’m yet to
establish a comfortable balance between the static site Q&As and the
more real-time responses on social networks.

This is why I’ve made this second Dear Alf entry this month, to get
through the questions you fans have been asking me in huge numbers over
the past few weeks. Let me know if you think I’m doing a good job
juggling the immediate replies with those I save for Dear Alf, or if you
think I’m not. The happier you guys are, the happier I am.

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Hey Alf, if there was any kind of machinery (Oddworld or
beyond) you’d like to try out, what would it be and how would you go
abouts using it?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I’d love to be able to drive a forklift. Just think of all the
heavy lifting I could get done! I’d be lifting whole crates of tea and
dumping them in giant cauldrons. When it’s time to close the Rehab, I
don’t have to drive everyone out with loud drumming, I can drive them
out with a motorized vehicle. And when I want a bonfire, just move the
wood myself instead of waiting for my lazy villager companions to do it
for me. Man, if I had a forklift, I’d be invincible.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf!
I heard about The Mudokon Queen today.I thought it was abe’s Mom
Lol.
But she is the Only female right?
Should we be able to see her?
I mean do you have any photos!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I’d like to be naïve here, but when a guy on the internet
starts getting excited and asking for photos of a female, I can’t just
shut my eyes, point in the right direction and hope for the best.
Luckily, no, I don’t got any photos for you. She’s been held under lock
and key for decades. But still, watch it, bub – that’s our mom you’re
talkin’ ’bout!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Will we ever get to see the mudokon queen (in Abe HD
maybe?)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I don’t think there’s a single Inhabitant who wants to keep the
Mudokon Queen chained away in some unseen prison factory. Well, I
suppose the ones that are doing the chaining. And those that are
benefiting from it. But everyone else is dead against it! It’s only a
matter of time before we break in there and bust her out! It’s just,
y’know, there’s a bunch of stuff I gotta get done first.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> If the vykkers keep your queen than where do native
mudokons come from?Is there another queen or they were born before your
queen was captured?(in that case they must be very old)Or are they
slaves who had escaped?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The Mudokons you’ve seen are mostly escapees from
‘civilization’, either slaves that broke free from their former
workplaces, like Abe, or hatched from eggs kidnapped from factory
nursaries. I’ve often wondered if there are Mudokon tribes somewhere out
there that are surviving free from industry’s labour trade. I imagine
them living in castles of chocolate and cloud, with every variety of tea
imaginable available on tap.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is Stranger the last…of his kind?And if there are others where do they
live?And how do they live?Have you met any and what do you think of
them?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> If there are any more… of Stranger’s kind, they’ve hidden
themselves well. You’d have to, to avoid being… noticed by the other
inhabitants. I can’t think of anyone who wouldn’t be fascinated to see
a… one of them.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf! Can you tell me all about this ‘Uwaya’ state that was
mentioned on an Unreleased Slig News clip?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oh man, you won’t catch me saying anything about the Uggae
Estate. Not with the lawyers those freaks have got. I hear it’s ruled by
a horrible monster that can literally scare you to death with its gaze.
Nope. I’m not going there.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, after I found out I have a tapeworm because of my
mother’s puppy having fleas. I feel worried and sick. I was wondering if
there any freaky parasites in Oddworld and could you let me know if you
anyone who has them. It would make me feel a little bit better.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> My friend Jimmy used to have a tapeworm. One day he was picking
his ear and pulled out a whole great loop of tapeworm, which snapped
off, leaving two ends of the tapework inside him. This would happen
every couple of days. We all got so grossed out. Hope you get better
soon.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> why is abe blue and why is his lips stitched is it because he
couldnt shaddap

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Abe’s lips were stitched to stop him from crying all the time.
You can’t work in a slaughterhouse if you’re going to spook the
livestock with your loud wailing. His stitches may have loosened over
the years, but that forced vow of silence taught Abe to keep his
emotions to himself, or at least keep them quiet. Abe is blue because
he’s sad. This doesn’t affect his job. Color is silent.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What type of shirt is Brewmaster wearing? I’d like to get one
but I do not know the proper name

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Your best bet is to start looking at chef jackets, preferably
single-breast (they are usually double-breasted). Unless you’re a
Glukkon, you’re unlikely to find quite the same design, but if you’re a
dab hand with a needle and thread, I’m sure you could create something
quite stunning.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> did abe fail his mission at Rupture Farms because there been
sighting of a Mudokon Pop advertisement in Abe’s Exoddus as well as Abe
mentioning them in Munch’s Oddysee. In Stranger’s Wrath HD, barrels of
Mudokon pops are seen throughout West Mudos. Do you think abe will have
to go back and do you think Molluck is behind it or some one from the
Magog Cartel mabe?

In abes exodus there is a poster for muddokon pops, and
in strangers wrath hd there are barrels full of mudokon pops. Does this
mean that Mudokon pops are still bieng made and if so, are you
worried?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You can shut down the company, but you can’t bury the idea.
Apparently Molluck shared his plans with someone who thought it would be
a good idea. That’s how business works, I’m afraid. I wouldn’t say Abe
failed, I’d say he’s incited a full-scale slave rebellion.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is Abe the only mudoken with the ability to posses
others? If not, than theoreticaly, if two mudokens possesed each other,
would that effectivley swap their bodies?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Abe is the only Mudokon I know with the ability to possess
others, but it’s not a power unique to him. It’s one of those
long-forgotten practices that wise old Mudokon shamans spent their
entire lives learning to perform for mere seconds at a time. There
always has to be someone who comes along and shows everyone else up, and
in the field of possession, that’s Abe. I don’t think Mudokons can
possess each other. I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night knowing Abe had
that kind of power.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Does this ability have anything to do with his odd blue coloration?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> What’s the obsession with trying to explain things as a
consequence of skin color!? Abe is blue because he has poor blood
circulation.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Did the glukkons have his lips stitched because they knew he had this
power?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The Glukkons publicly deny that Mudokons have any psychic
powers of any kind, but did you notice all those chant suppressors that
fill every single factory you’d care to stumble across? Those devious
liars know more than they’re saying!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What did General Dripik do to get his medals?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They’re not for success in battle, if that’s what you’re
thinking. He got them for making lots of Moolah.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Whats the secret recipie to your tea?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Secret.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Are slogs, scrabs and parmites blind?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They’re blind in that they don’t use light to see the world,
but they’re far from being unaware of their environment. There are other
ways to perceive your surroundings. Paramites use their advanced sense
of smell, Slogs have acute hearing, and Scrabs sense the electric fields
that are affected by objects and creatures around them.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was playing munchs odyssey when I saw the newspaper about the lulu
fund, at the bottom there was a picture of a group of glukkons, in this
group I saw director phleg, vp aslik and someone who resembled general
Dripik, did these 3 not die in soulstorm brewery (because im pretty sure
they all exploded).

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It’s probably just an old stock photo they didn’t have to pay
any royalties for. Don’t put too much stock in those rags! They’d torch
their own staff if that’s what it took to get a story to sell like hot
Scrab Cakes. The Daily Deception’s editors are in it for the bottom line
as much as any other industrialist creep.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf. I was playing Strangers Wrath on PC and completed
the game. The end where Mr. Sekto escapes. Is there going to be a sequel
to the game or just gone. Pretend that Mr.Sekto leaves and never comes
back for revenge? :)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> How do you know he can’t just accept defeat and go do some
other business venture? Everyone’s so negative these days. Ya just gotta
look for the best in folks!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hey alf i was wondering, who do the glukkons sell their
products to. it seems fairly pointless just making products to give to
employees, there’s no profit margin. so is there another “consumer” race
on oddworld that actually buys the paramite pies, scrab cakes etc.?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sure, there’s millions of Khanzumerz. You just haven’t seen
them yet because you’re following the exploits of the little guy in the
Third World.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey alf. What’s the ponytails on mudokons made of? Snakes
or regular hair.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> What are you talkin’ about, snakes? This ain’t Greek mythology,
ya clown! Mudokons have feather-like hair that can be put in a hundred
and one styles, and the ponytail just happens to be one of the most
practical. Myself I prefer the elegance of a topknot. You get all the
safety aspects of the ponytail, but it’s so wonderfully stylish and
makes me look awesome.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Also How do sligs walk with rounded feet?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Pretty darn well, I’d say!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey there Alf-san! Hows the tea? I have two questions.
First is how did the inhabitants of Oddworld develop a Germanic language
such as English as their lingua franca throughout the entire planet
along with the Latin alphabet? How did everyone start using them? Im
sure everyone had their own unique language (besides the whistling and
mechanical grunts). I mean the unique names of everything in Oddworld
does point out there must be something. Also with the usage of “Gulags”
im guessing someone (or something) must have spoken Russian at some
point in time?

<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I’ll go ahead guess you’ve been exposed to Oddworld in an
English-speaking country. Those fans who live in France, German, Italy
or Spain probably disagree with what we speak. It’s translation for the
sake of you guys that don’t understand the languages of Oddworld. The
various races, cultures and classes on Oddworld all developed with their
own languages and dialects. Native people used ancient tongues that
tended towards melody and harmony, reflecting their overall cultural
attitudes. The industrialists shrugged off their heritage in favor of
language that enabled their lifestyles, becoming at the same time more
clinically accurate and shamelessly deceitful.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Second is a simple one. What does Abe live in? Maybe a
house/hut/rondavel/shack/kraal/homestead or nothing at all? (yes me is
South African)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Abe’s got his own hut, but I don’t go there unless it’s urgent.
It’s always filled with toadying, over-awed fanmuds who clutter up the
place with their useless reverency. I’m happy for Abe, I really am, but
those guys need to get off their praise train and get to work building
my bonfire!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Are the clackers, outlaws, and stranger living in the same
time you are or from the past?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Their story is happening at the same time as ours, just in a
different part of the land.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hey alf i was wondering, i’ve heard of a very old story about
something called nod’s oddysee, some places on the net say it was a real
oddworld project that was cancelled others say it was started by some
forum. was this ever an idea for an oddworld game?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It’s always satisfying to put an annoying rumor to bed. I have
never in my life heard of anyone called Nod, and I can assure you that
no one has a name as silly as that. So quit believing any old thing you
hear and put your faith in sensibly-named characters, like Munch and
Squeek.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hey alf are there any fuzzles that the vykkers havent captured
before vykkers labs got destroyed? by that i mean are there any native
fuzzles

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There are wild Fuzzles all over the place. You have to watch
where you tread to avoid upsetting them, or you’ll shortly be donating
an ankle.They’re so overprotective. I only wanted to give them a cuddle!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> When Stranger was doing bounty work, would it be possible that abe and
munch could appear on there someday if so,how would the mudokons,
fuzzles, and munch and abe react if someone was on there way to bounty
them and how much would they be worth?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> If it were to happen, I suppose Abe and Munch would be
worried and watch their back. How much would they be worth? I dunno.
They’ve done much, much worse to the Glukkon economy than any of the
Outlaws have done to the Clakkerz. But Abe and Munch aren’t in Western
Mudos, and even if they were, the Glukkons are more likely to hire
professional security services than outsource their work to local
entrepreneurs.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Alf, are you wanted by somebody? Are there Mudoken
Police?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I think you must be confusing me with somebody else. I’ve never
broken any law, except that time I threw an empty bottle of Brew at a
Slig guard. Luckily there was a boiler for me to dive behind and he
never worked out it was me, although he did give me funny looks after
that. Probably because every time I saw him I burst out laughing. Then
he’d beat me and I’d stop, but it was worth it every time.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hey alf i have two questions the first one is why do all
mudokens don’t wear shirts is it to show off their abs and have sligs
ever sang before

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Those are two very good questions, but we are tragically out of
time for this month. Ain’t that sad!

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: how do the weirdo’s in exeduss have their powers???

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It’s a lot easier to be in tune with the hidden, mystic powers
of the spirit world when you’re looking at it from within the hidden,
mystic spirit world!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I have a question for you alf do mudokons have last names??

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yeah, of course! When you only have one name, your entire name
is your last name!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, I dunno if you’re familiar with Stranger and all but
I was curious about something. Has he ever had any interactions with
Mudokons? Or has he never ventured to that part of Oddworld?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well he’s certainly never wandered into my Rehab, if that’s
what you’re suggesting. We have an expression here. It goes “Like a
Ste-” ummm, “Like a Stranger in a tea shop.” It means that Stranger
would send the cups and saucers and doilies flying everywhere! There
would be the smashed crockery, the injuries, the insurance claims, and
that’s not saying a thing about the horn-torn upholstry. Funnily enough,
we have another, similar expression. It goes “Like a Scrab in a tea
shop.” And the closely related “Like an Elum in an apiary.”
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, I’ve got a question for you. In the game Stranger’s
Wrath Stranger seems as though he’s just on a personal agenda throughout
the whole game even after he is rescued by the natives. So I was
wondering, does he actually care about what happens to the natives, or
was he just helping them so that they could help him get revenge on
Sekto?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There comes a point where the two of those are one and the
same. Stranger may have started out looking after his own hide, even
once he knew Sekto would be coming after him, but it’s only by
discovering and embracing his noble heritage that he managed to
accomplish that. Sekto destroyed the land of the Grubbs and put
Stranger’s life at incredible risk. Stranger is a born guardian kept
apart from his, uh, guardees by societal pressures. His desire to
protect the natives is his personal agenda.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf will Oddworld be destroyed on the 21/12/12
cause I think the Mayans warned you it would.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hey! Don’t you have a go at me for answering this so much later
than the given date! I just… wanted to be sure. Seriously, don’t let
modern spins on ancient knowledge fool you. If you could convince a
superstitious bunch of people that mystical ancients foresaw an
unavoidable end in the near future, how much would those people stand up
for their longevity when you exploited their resources and rights?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Alf have you ever thought of doing a mudokon version of
magog on the march and posting it on the website? if so please do it, it
will be like a video version of Dear Alf

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Some of my buds run the FUD Network, a Mudokon broadcasting
group dedicated to revealing the truth behind Glukkon industry. I’ve
been offered my own slot, but I just don’t got the time, ya know? I’d
have to starch my fez, powder my nose… and I’ve barely got enough time
to respond to my bulging mailbags as it is!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hows it going Alf? I just wanted to something off my and
ask you whats that thing hangin in the back of Abes head?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> His ponytail? It’s a ponytail. It’s made from our fabulous
feather-like hair. Factory owners like to have it tied up or shaved
completely to reduce unproductive accidents and promote
confidence-sapping conformity. Usually once Muds are free we like to
start exploring our own styles, but Abe keeps his as a kind of reminder
of his past.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hey alf if muds have feathers do u think then that muds evolved
from some type of bird or bird like creature

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Makes sense to me! It explains my all-day yearning to take off
and fly away from all this! But that’s not going to happen anytime soon,
so back to answering letters!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Genshi fascinated by mudokon species. But one thing Genshi no
understand; Oddworld wikia say mudokon evolve from birds if mudokon type
of bird that make them archosaur species yet unlike all archosaur
species mudokon have mouth in stead of beak, flat nails like simian
primate, and four digits on hand like artiodactyl. But genshi no know
what “birds” on Oddworld look like so mudokon may look much like
Oddworld bird.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Archosaur? Artiodactyl? I don’t know what those are. Maybe your
birds and people evolved in very different ways to ours. Your world
sounds weird.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Also, Genshi curious about mudokon female. There only one known
mudokon female. Where rest of them? without females mudokon species die
so there must be female Mudokons somewhere.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well I guess that makes sense, so they must be somewhere, but I
sure haven’t seen them. But then by that logic there’d have to be male
Mudokons as well, and I haven’t seen any of those either.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Oh and PS: How long are the days on Oddworld — in hours? Thanks!

How far is the planet of Oddworld from Earth?

where is oddworld and is there realy hd abe coming out

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oddworld exists in a different part of reality, another
dimension, a bajillion light millennia away in all and zero directions,
utterly unrelated to the world you know, a fractured reflection of each
other’s world. We’ve got our own sun and orbit and rotation and time
zones and clocks and calendars and laws of relativity. Converting
between coordinates and times doesn’t make much sense.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, I was just curious how you communicated with us? Does
Oddworld have some sort of trans-solar system communication
technology?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> A really, really long well.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What ever happened to big face after abe’s oddysee?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> He stayed at Monsaic Lines and helped rescued Mudokons come to
grips with their new life of freedom. He also started to learn
photorealism, but he got bored of it and went back to rockart.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> also what where meeches like and do u think that maybe just maybe
there may still be meeches living in parts of oddworld that the glukkons
havent gotten to yet?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I never had the pleasure of meeting a Meech in person, but I’m
told by the livestock handlers from the Farms they were not something
you wanted to let anywhere near you. One on its own would spell doom
enough, a whole flock of them would plow through anything they wanted.
Alas, no more! Meeches only lived around where Molluck built
RuptureFarms, so when their homeland was reduced to wasteland, they went
the way of the, well, the Meech.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey, Alf! Where’s Crig lately?? He owes me some moolah.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You don’t seriously expect to get that Moolah, do you? Sure, I
could tell you where he is. But then he could bring a bunch of cronies
and shoot my rehab up. Nah, you’re ok. Just make do with your remaining
peenies.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Also, what are some of your favorite activities for your spare time?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> When I’m not sitting down with recovering Brewaholics, I like
to play games with my Mudokon brethren, such as Sliggy in the Middle, or
Hide & Squeek. I also enjoy a good book: right now I’m deep in Fez and
Lapsang in Fegas, and after that I want to move on to Go Ask Aslik.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear alf i am wondering if there is a easier way to explode soul storm
brew

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You could throw a lit match at it. What do you have in mind? A
decorative pyrotechnic display or a vindictive factory demolition?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> does abe or you have google+

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There’s an [Oddworld Inhabitants Google+
Page](https://plus.google.com/u/0/116666104154732503427/posts) if that
helps.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 1) Do Mudokon’s ever cold at all?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Of course! Winter is as tough for us as anyone else, but we
survive with bonfires, thick coats and shivering a lot. We also turn the
thermostat way up, and stick our feet in the oven. Next question.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2) Did you try any foods at Rupturefarms?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> ‘Try’? No, I never ‘tried’ it. It was the only food there was.
We were forced to eat it or starve. But that was ok because at the time
we didn’t know what we were eating. All we knew was it tasted great and
we couldn’t wait until the next cold slither of it was gifted to us from
the nearest dispenzah.

3) Did you guys never met those Grubbs before in the Western Mudos?

</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Forgive me if you’ve answered a question similar to this
before, but I was wondering…Your community, your whole ‘gathering’ of
mudo’s you got goin’ on there; Is there some kind of leader or superior,
that maybe guides what happens? I figured that the Almighty Raisin,
Bigface and even you and Abe would probably have their words a little
bit more valued than others! (No offense of course to anyone else) Or is
it a democracy? Either way man, I’d be pretty content living there – you
guys are awesome.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Traditianally, villages tend to govern themselves, usually in
line with their parent tribe, whose elders in turn heed the wisdom of
ancients and prophets like Shamans, Spirits and the Almighty Raisin.
Right now tribes have all but dispanded, secretive clans hidden
themselves away from industrialist meddling, far-flung vestiges of purer
existence on the fringes of populated land. An active leader like Abe
might be able to bring them all together by adventuring to their
settlements and organizing propaganda drives.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf, I was always wondering if english is official
language in Mudos (or entire Oddwolrd), or is it just translated to it.
Which one of these theories is correct?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I’ve never heard of ‘english’. Is it like a cross between a
Glukkon and a Fish?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why and when the Vykkers and Glukkons did become “friends”?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You’re right to put ‘friends’ inside inverted commas. They’re
not friends, they’re competing companies. One tends to focus on resource
extraction and manufacture while the other mostly sticks to
pharmaceuticals and robotics, but they do share some markets, for
instance, food. Even then they’re competing for lands, contracts,
marketing… don’t ever mistake them for friends! On the other hand,
they’ll work together if they both feel they can get something out of
it. In fact, Vykkers are contracted for a lot of research and
technology, just as they contract work out to yet other industrial
families. The economic landscape of Oddworld is a twisted web.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> All the glukkons and wolvarks and them know that abe’s gonna
come and ruin the day by either A:Turning Invisible. B: throwing their
own grenades at them. C: Drinking coffee. and finaly D: Possessing them.
SO why don’t they cobble it together and get rid of all the vendos and
put in a chant supressor every 10 feet and put a security code onto the
BOOM machines?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Whoa whoa whoa!! That’s not an inexpensive plan of operation!
Get rid of the Vendos… what would the workers eat? A chant supressor
every 10 feet… do you have any idea how much a self-powered anti-gravity
tesla coil costs? A security code on grenade dispenzahs? Well, that’s
actually not a bad idea but it would still be a more expensive model.
There comes a point when you have to figure it’s more profitable to
claim the insurance and start a new factory somewhere else.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf! Thanks for answering my previous question.
I’m more of a Mudomo chap myself. ANyway, I’m just wodnering, How tall
is a Kinto Slave in comparison to a Mud?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> A foot shorter, about the same size as a panted Slig. Roughly.
You try measuring one accurately when they’re freaking out about the
clouds overhead.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Alf! At last, it is a great honour for me to talk with
you. I have a question: Which Glukkons survive in Exoddus? Im putting
this question beacuse in Munch’s Odysee, in a newspaper we find Director
Phleg and General Drippik tagged in a picture. As far as i know, Abe
posessed each Glukkon ( V.P Aslik, Phleg and Drippik ) in order to gain
access to SoulStorm Brewery.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I don’t think you’re familiar with the fantastic cost-cutting
measure known as ‘stock photo’. Those cheap tabloids will cut any corner
to get their ridiculous point across earlier than the competition. The
early rag gets the Moolah!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, Will shrinks be in any upcoming oddworld game and
what are they exacly

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Shrinks are mechanical company psychologists, built to increase
the productivity of workers. Whether that encouragement comes in the
form of a supportive compliment or emotional blackmail is no one’s
concern as long as it gets results.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, i need to ask for your guidance on a moral matter
that is preventing me to sleep pacefully.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I know Abe can’t use sligs weapons cause he don’t want to be
swayed by glukkon mentality but why he show no restraint in using
granades?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> In case the answer is something like “he simply don’t like guns”
please go and slap him one time for all the troubles that gave us.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, you know. Guns are heavy. Abe can fit several grenades in
his pocket. It’s easier!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, you know Abe can possess pratically anything
(Bells, farts, sligs, slogs, etc), does that mean he can possess other
mudokons? I mean, he could be doing it to you right now! Is he? If he
is, hi Abe!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I certainly hope he can’t, because that would be proper scary!
I mean, possessing the thing trying to kill you is one thing, possessing
your pal from across the road takes on horrible implications. What if
you learnt something you wish you’d never known, like “I don’t like
tea”? That’s going to scar you for life. It’s better Abe keeps his
possession to other species.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I have enjoyed the oddworld games for a long time and i hope
they continue. Two questions have been pondering my mind though. Back in
the days when abe had to rescue so many mudokons in exoddus. Why is it
that Abe never feels really bad when he kills a mudokon? If he killed
one by accident or if he was being mean, on purpose, all he could say
was “oops” and move on, he didnt stop, cry or even apologise to friends
nearby if he killed one of their buddies.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Make no mistake, Abe feels pain and suffering and sadness,
often in a much deeper way that the Mudokons around him. But when he
kills a Mudokon he knows… he knows that… um…. Abe has never killed a
Mudokon. What, err, what are you talking about? Have you ever killed a
Mudokon?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What happened after that old, blind guy fell to his death in
Abe’s Exoddus? Abe told him to follow him, only to make him walk right
into a big hole and then break his legs. Was he missed or at least
remembered in the village?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> His broken bones healed really quickly and Abe rescued him a
little bit later. We were all very relieved.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> My other question is if glukkons have no arms, then who built
the sligs

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> By “built the Sligs” I’m gonna suppose you mean their pants.
Like most widespread appliances, they’re designed by Vykkers but
commercially manufactured by Glukkons.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> and why is it that slogs respect them so much that they would even
attack a glukkon if a slig commanded it,

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Um, you said two questions. This is number three, but that’s
fine. Slogs don’t respect Sligs. They obey them because they’ve been
brutally raised to know they’ll get beaten, starved and generally abused
if they don’t. Glukkons don’t get involved in the process, so when a
Slog sees a Glukkon it doesn’t recognize it as anything special to be
protected.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> which reminds me, if sligs are stronger than glukkons, why dont they
just kill em and take over.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Jeez, another question? You said two. This is your last
one. Sligs aren’t stronger than Glukkons, because Glukkons control the
Moolah. A Slig without Moolah is a Slig withoun a gun, pants or smokes.
And a Slig without those is a sticky mess on the bottom of some guy’s
boots.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> a slig revolution should i say?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> NO. JUST SHUT UP.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Two questions for you Alf: 1) Abe’s voice changed a little compared to Oddysee. Why is that?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Freed slaves love to learn about the forgotten practices of
their people. Art, stories, building, hunting, tea brewing: our lives
transform from drudgery to discovery. When your soul is uplifted in that
way, your voice tends to follow suit.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2) How come Scrabs in Abe’s Oddysee/Exoddus are very territorial and
agressive towards other Scrabs and in Munch’s Oddysee they walk in
groups? Maybe they realized that they’re few in Oddworld (since
RuptureFarms reduced most to cakes) and they thought that’s safer to
hang in herds?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> In the wild, Alpha Scrabs keep control over herds of lesser
Scrabs. If you thought a single Scrab was lethal, wait till you
encounter the whole dance troupe! The poor creatures in the temples have
been locked in small spaces for years and gone a bit cranky. Or maybe
they’re just trying to hug each other.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf,While in Munch’s Oddysee we see a glukkon lab
with mudoken slaves, (my apologies,) and there are a few sparse bird
portals.The bird portals in Munch’s Oddysee seem different then the
ones in the games wherein Abe works alone. Was there a reason for this,
aside from technology moving forward?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Just as the species of bird you’ll see change from region to
region, so too will the portals they form.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hellllo Alf my magnificent mudokon message man ,I merely have
one small either request or suggestion .perhaps there could be some sort
of Meech related odyssey involving the last Meech maybe .oh and also I
must complement you on your marvelous fez you have there, perched atop
your head like a red crown of wisdom adding infinite amounts of
coolenosities to your fine being. Oh ah ,sorry,one final thing it seems
we have a lot of unwanted sligs roaming about oddworld like trigger
happy autumn leaves ,anyway my idea is, for a renewable food source …
slig stew and slog sandwiches ,oh and how about slurg sundaes .I’m sure
the glukkons won’t mind much .Or maybe fleech frazzles or fleech
flapjacks ,something to think about tarahh for now Alf.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I don’t think there are any Meeches left to go on an Oddysee
for. Thank you, I love my Fez. I don’t think I can imagine a less
appetizing set of creatures. Next question!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, i was just wondering, in munch’s oddysee on levels
such as Dead River, are all those events taking place on a mountain?
Because it seems when fall off the cliff, i fall into clouds.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Maybe it’s just a foggy day down in the valleys and lowlands. A
more important question is why are you walking off the cliff? Clouds or
no, that kind of behaviour leads to injury. Sit down, my friend. Here’s
some tea. Tell Alfie all about it.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Also, do you own and ride your own elum?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I like to ride my Elum far into the forests where I know no one
will ask me annoying questions. No, I won’t let you borrow it, you’re
not covered by the insurance.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Sup Alf, I wanted to know how Munch must feel. After
the sonar that punctured his skull and how the baby Gabbits are doing. I
also wanted to know why abe never seems to put on any weight in all of

<p><b>Alf:</b> I haven’t actually seen any baby Gabbits around, so either they
haven’t come out of the water yet or they haven’t even come out of the
can. I hope Munch doesn’t leave them in the can too long, something that
shiny and rare is going to attract the attention of a passing industrial
creep.

Abe not put on weight? You’re obviously not the dedicated friend who’s
had to carry him home after a night out.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Are Sligs naturally two-limbed creatures with vestigal
tails? Or are modern-day Sligs the degenerate descendants of
‘proto-Sligs’ who lost their legs (and perhaps their eyes and faces) due
to the use of mechanical replacement appendages?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sligs have two limbs, it’s just how Odd made them. They also
have eyes and faces, it’s just that the less you see them, the better
you sleep at night.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, I promise to only post this question once this time, in
Abe’s Exoddus I noticed all the mudokon skulls were toothless but then
during the cutscene in Munch’s Oddysee where Abe is pushed into the big
well they have teeth, so do mudokons have teeth or not?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I should think if you’ve seen us with teeth in our mouth, then
we have teeth in our mouth. Anatomy 101.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hello once again Alf. I have more questions: 1. I was wondering, if the bad ending of Abe’s Exoddus was canon,how different would your life be?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well I wouldn’t have opened a popular chain of rehabs for
starters. I probably wouldn’t have the job of answering all these
questions. Hey, is it too late to make it canon?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2. The Zapplies that Stranger has are always with him. They must be
pretty loyal. Can you tell me how he got them and that vacuum-thing he
bounties creatures with?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Zappflies aren’t rare in the scorched desert. He probably just
has a lump of rotten meat in his ammo bag to attract them. His bounty
can, now that’s a weird contraption. Imagine being able to keep large
creatures in tiny containers. It’s just nonsense!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf, I was wondering, if there was any religion on OddWorld
and if so which one is the main ones and do the natives and
industrialists follow separate ones, thamks

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There are almost as many religions and beliefs on Oddworld as
there are Inhabitants! Native Mudokons cling to their old traditions
which are typically a mix of animism, ancestor worship, shamanism and so
on, although the specifics differ between tribes. Industrial races have
mostly abandoned spirituality so they can pursue profit without any
pesky morals getting in the way, but weaker minded species subscribe to
fearful superstitions.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, I have a couple of questions for you.
Firstly, does the Mudokon species actually change colour depending on
their mood, or is that “chameleon-like-feature” only visible to the
player to make game play easier?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Our skin certainly changes color with our mood. Doesn’t yours?
It’s probably not as dramatic as you make it sound, though.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Also, what can you tell us about the Vykkers and the Vykkers
Conglomerate that we don’t already know?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> That depends entirely on what you don’t already know. Tell you
what, let me know what you don’t already know, and then I’ll tell it
back to you. How’s that sound?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I read somewhere that Muds are descended from birds, which
makes the portals, feathery ponytails and general fragility of Mudokons
highly understandable. But what about Clackers? Are they just short, fat
Muds, or do they stem from another genealogy completely?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Mudokons related to Clakkerz??? I’ve never heard anything so
absurd in all my life.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is there any relation between paramite and scrabs? If I
rember right early artwork call them “arachnid jr.” and “arachnid sr.”
respectively.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You people won’t be happy until every Oddworld creature is
cousins with every other Oddworld creature!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 1. In AE, Abe uses SoulStorm brew for his farting powers. How
come he didn’t get addicted to the stuff like the other Mudokons did? He
drank quite a lot of it.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> What you didn’t get to see is all the time Abe spent in my
rehab getting over the dependence he’d developed. It wouldn’t exactly
have made good gameplay.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2. What food do the Natives eat? Surely not the products sold by the
Glukkons!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No, that stuff is bad! Filled with toxins and plastics and
nasties. We get our food from growing and harvesting plants, and from
rearing and hunting critters. Of course we do it all sustainably, with
total respect for nature and the land and the food itself.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 3. What ever happened to Big Face?! I read somewhere that he went into
hiding because he thought he accidently killed Abe when he knocked him
of the podium??

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> He’s not hiding in my basement! Uh oh… Please don’t call the
Mudokops!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 4. What does Abe do all day, now that he seems to have some spare
time?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Watch videos of himself on YouTube.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 5. And finally, I know you guys can view fan art (considering you have
a section on this website dedicated to it; which I will contribute to
when the holidays come around) and on the old website you had OddVerse,
but can you guys also read Fanfiction? I know novel writters can’t, but
can you guys? (I really hope so!)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Generally not, for much the same reasons. We’ve got our own
stories to tell, and if they just happen to resemble ones sent to us,
that could be seen as suspicious unless we’ve made it perfectly clear we
don’t read fan fiction. Don’t get us wrong, it thrills us to see folks
having the inspiration to get creative, so keep at it!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What do Mudokon babies look like?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They look like full grown Mudokons but smaller. Oversized heads
and eyes, they’re tremendously cute. In photos, anyway. Put the camera
away and it’s all tantrums and diaper changes.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I got 2 questions. First, if we ever do get to see the end of the
Quintology, will there be 5 moons?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> This question intrigued me, so I went to ask my astrology buddy
if moons could suddenly appear over time. He gave me a weird look and
told me in no uncertain terms that just because Munch’s Moon
spontaneously manifested in the sky, doesn’t mean three more will. I
asked what would happen if they did, and he just huffed and puffed about
having to redraw all his charts again. That guy bugs me. I hope there’ll
be more moons.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Also, I am currently working on a Mudokon costume (big fan). In order
to do so I banded some of my fingers together, and they are now changing
colors. Should I see a doctor, or use the coloring as the rest of the
costumes skin tone?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You don’t say what color your fingers have turned, so I’m going
to presume it’s a healthy green hue. If that’s the case, then your skin
is probably just reverting to its natural state. Years of living indoors
dulls one’s vibrancy. A return to nature restores skin tones and overall
health, physical and emotional. Alternatively, you’ve picked up a dermal
fungus. Go to your doctor and get that stuff scrubbed off.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I have always wondered where outlaws got there names from? I
mean Where Do the names Blisters Booty and Boils Booty come from? And
please tell me theres a deeper meaning then i think ;P. But Why would
outlaws ever follow a guy named Fatty McBoomBoom or X’plosive McGee?
Abe, Alf, or Munch, now those are names I would want to follow behind.
Stranger’s kinda Scary but he still did the mongo valley a whole lot of
good so he’s OK in my Book:)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> What’s in a name? You wouldn’t rank Outlaws highly for the
hygeine, intelligence or morals, so why compare their nomenclature
against gold standards like “Alf”? Outlaw bosses get where they are
through successful villainry and thuggery. Silly names don’t factor into
it. “His name is laughable, but he could still kick all our asses, so
let’s fall in line.”
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What is the life expectancy in years for a Mudokon?
Same question for a Gabbit and a Steef?
This has really been bugging me lately.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I’d tell you what’s been bugging me lately, but I want to keep
my job. Let’s say 40 years, 18 years and Odd knows, respectively.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div><h2><a id="dear-alf-october-2011-volume-1"></a>dear-alf-october-2011-volume-1<br>(Posted on: 10/2011)</h2><center><a href="#toc">Back to the top</a></center><br>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Okay, I’ve been wondering this for a while, since after I beat
Munch’s Oddysee maybe: How tall are the Oddworld characters? Like Munch
and Abe? What about those greasy sligs? I mean, I’ve seen the credit
picture at the end of Munch’s Oddysee and Munch looks huge compared to
the people in it, as do the fuzzles! I always thought they were tiny,
lol!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Let’s start with Abe. Abe is a perfectly respectable 5-foot-8.
Munch is about 4-foot-6, Sligs are 5-foot when on foot and not asleep,
Glukkons can be anywhere from 7 to 9 foot tall! Stranger is 9 foot tall,
Snoozers are 15-foot, Gloktigi are 15-foot or taller! Slurgs aren’t
measured in feet, they’re measured in decibels.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, I have been curious for the longest time about the
taste of the products the Glukkons manufactured. I’m sure you have at
least sampled some of the products during your time as a slave. What did
Meech Munchies taste like? How about Scrab Cakes? Paramite Pies?
Soulstorm Brew? Hold on — do Mudokons even have taste buds? Thanks in
advance for reading this.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Of course we have taste buds! If we didn’t, we wouldn’t be able
to taste the sweet, salty flakiness of a Scrab Cake or the tangy,
spongey processed flesh of a Paramite Pie. Oh, and the bubbling,
foaming, refreshing, revitalizing glory that is SoulStorm Brew. Oh durn
it, I’ve gotta get in touch with my sponsor. Thanks a bunch, you pro.
Here’s your Doctorate in Temptation.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Alf, I wanted to ask ya somethin’. I don’t know what may have
happened post-Munch’s Oddysee. I mean, with the destruction of Vykkers
Labs and all, those sleazy Industrial punks have fallen into recession,
haven’t they?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Some have, but we’ve only just started chipping away at the
full extent of capitalism on Mudos. There are more industrial families
than you can shake a Stunk at, and more coniving tactics to survive
financial hardship than a Vykker has varicose veins.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> And are the outlaws all the members of the same race or
not?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No, there are dozens of outlaw species stradling the line
between Moolah-greedy bastards and victims of industrial revolution.
What were once distinct cultures have conglomerated into a cut-throat
society of opportunists who only knows how to survive by stealing and
cheating. If they all look similar to your eyes, that’s probably a
result of convergent evolution, interbreeding and homogenized fashion.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> i was wondering whats the poytail on modukons

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It’s a ponytail, genius. It’s what happens when our feathery
hair is tied behind our heads, as Glukkons tend to force us to do. It’s
just another way they distance us from our cultural heritage and sense
of freedom. Plus, it helps keep heads getting snagged in the legal
papers shredder.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I’ve always wondered how exactly you catch a scrab to make scrab
cakes, I mean, they’re not exactly the tamest of creatures.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You don’t need to tame them to catch them, but you do need one
or several of the following: nimbleness, strong rope, a gun, heavy
armor, fleetness of foot, a foot trap, boxcars, enough kahonees for a
game of billiards. It helps to tame them, but that’s not in the
interests of RuptureFarms. Dragging them kicking and screaming to a
crampt outdoors pen does just fine.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf is there gonna be any backstory on the old
Mud tribes from the first two games?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The old Mudokon tribes are the backstory…
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, got another question for ya. Where does the game
Strangers Wrath take place on Oddworld,or does it even take place in the
same time period?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The Mongo River Valley is in Western Mudos, the same continent
where Abe and Munch have been going on a factory-bankrupting frenzy.
Stranger’s Wrath and Munch’s Oddysee take place at roughly the same
time.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf! I’ve just been wonderin’, what ever happened to
“Stranger” the steef? Will he be capturin’ more outlaws or even meet Abe
at some point? Have you even seen him yourself? He is the last of his
kind, right? :(

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I’ve never met a Steef, what with them living on the other side
of the continent and all. Last we saw the Strange Steef Dude he’d led
hundreds of Grubbs to their deaths and discovered the horrible fate of
an old Steef. But hey, at least he brought the fish back so the natives
can eat again. I believe that’s what we call a Pyloric Victory.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 1-when you put 2 scrabs together they kill each other but…what
if:scrab+paramite?,scrab+slog?,scrab+bats/bees?,scrab+elum?…I got a lot
of questions about creature reactions but that’s enough for now.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yes, the Scrab would kill any of them that weren’t wise enough
to run and hide. Except probably bats and bees, I can’t imagine why a
Scrab would waste his energy on such little critters unless it was
particularly hungry.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2-do the mudokons pay you when they drink tea?,how do they pay
you?(with mollah or something)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Recovering addicts get their rehabilitation for free. It’s all
part and parcel of their reintegration into native society. Making them
do chores to earn that tea is part and parcel of teaching them they
still need to work for the good of the community. If someone wants to
come and get served a nice meal or cuppa and I’m not too busy with work,
they can pay for it in kind: I don’t need or charge any stinkin’ Moolah!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 3-last not least..is there’s a mudokon/slig female?,is there’s any
changes between scrab/paramite/slog males and females ?,when do they
appear?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The majority of Oddworld creatures are super species: they have
very few males and even fewer females. All the Mudokons and Sligs we’ve
seen so far are sexless workers with no reproductive capacity. They
exist, in a biological sense, to serve the breeding castes for the good
of the bloodline. That doesn’t stop us being individuals with hopes and
dreams, but it does stop us being motivated by anything mushy.

In order to save your mind from blowing up that’s all for now. I shall
tell you if you get 1 mollah for every question I have then getting 10
billion mollah would be less sorry for those questions.

What am I going to spend Moolah on? Scrab Cakes? Gabbiar? A huge luxury
dirigible with my face painted on the side? Actually…
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Alf why is it everywhere you look in oddworld there are no
females for any species except glukkens as they have a queen unless its
a drag queen. any way why are there no females and where do mudoken eggs
come from? thanks Alf.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The females are the queens, and we haven’t seen them yet. The
males are the drones, and we haven’t seen them yet either. Mudokon eggs
come from Mudokon queens’, well, from Mudokon queens.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> So, Fleeches were originally Glukkon pets before getting flushed
down the toilet? Given the, shall we say, borderline homicidal behavior
Fleeches are known for, how was such a thing possible? Strict obedience
training?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It’s not a problem when they’re small. When they’re small, the
worst damage they can do is remove dirt and grime from all those
hard-to-reach places, which is exactly why they’re sold as pets in the
first place. The trouble starts when they grow big and bloodlusty enough
to do physical damage. It’s no coincidence that this is when they get
flushed.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 1: Is it the same Elum in both Paramonia and Scrabania or are
they identical (and equally smelly) relatives?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I keep asking Elum this very question but all he does is grunt
at me. I offer him honey if he answers, he just licks his lips, wags his
tail and follows me for the rest of the day. I tell ya, if Abe’s steed
in Paramonia and Scrabania was as uncooperative as he tells me, they’re
one and the same.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2: In the first cut scene of the second disc of Abe’s Exoddus, we see
Aslik, Dripik, and Phleg bickering about Abe getting into Feeco Depot.
One of them says “Molluck is gonna be pissed!” Is this a hint that
Molluck might still be around somewhere in hiding, or do the other
Glukkons just not know that he’s dead?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Doesn’t matter. If you boss is ruthless enough, you’d be scared
of them whether they were dead, comatose, missing or on vacation. And
Molluck is one ruthless boss. I once saw him have a worker thrown into a
pit of Scrabs just because he’d eaten the last donut in the factory
canteen.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Have Rupture Farms discovered all the delicious recipes with
Clakkers yet?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Delicious as the products may be, even I doubt the Glukkons
would attempt to market snack foods made out of members of civilized
society. I certainly don’t see them selling well in any Clakker
township, do you?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> what I don’t like about abe is wy shoud he save the
Mudokons wy don’t they save them-self but I think they had power like
abe that would be so awsome so then they could defened them-self so that
what I don’t like about abe =)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You’ve got to be kidding. Abe is the weakest, weaseliest,
weediest Mudokon you’re likely to find this side of a forced starvation
camp. He sees his buddies become fighters, soldiers and warriors all
around him while he stays on the sidelines and would get smooshed in a
second if danger ever fought its way through to him. Abe’s strength
isn’t even really his mystical powers, although they helpful from time
to time; it’s his bravery, his conviction, his heart and righteousness.
You can’t just give those qualities to others, they have to learn them
for themselves.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is there a possibility of a release of the music from the
PS1 Abe games either on CD or through iTunes or something like that? I
love the music in those games and if you made it available for purchase,
I would buy it right away!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> That’s a bit tough. Have you heard how dynamic the music in
those games is? It’s also composed on the fly with loads of different
low-bit sounds, not nice high-quality tracks. If we release a proper
soundtrack we want it to be better than that.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Alf, Have you been to space yet?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Uh, not yet. I didn’t realize it was in my schedule. Let me
check. Uhhhhhhhh… oh, you’re absolutely correct! It’s right here between
diving to the bottom of the ocean and mining to the center of Oddworld.
Oh damn, I missed the deadlines for all of those. Looks like it’s never
going to happen. What a shame.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I have been wondering lately, how does the entire rehab thing
going?

I have noticed that sometimes when you answer question from fans you
seem somewhat cranky. Maybe i am misunderstanding things, but is there
something more recent bothering you?

Is the tea not as helpful anymore? You can always try and mix in some
other hebrs, just be careful not to add anything as or more addictive
then SoulStorm brew by accident.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Look here, sonny, you’d get cranky too if you had to sift your
way through my mailbags. Oh, the messages I’m sent! Those same questions
over and over because people won’t take the time to [READ THE
FAQ](http://www.oddworld.com/?page_id=520) I spent so long putting
together and maintaining; The dedicated fans that watch my every move,
breathing down my neck when I’m trying to enjoy my private time; The
messages from my boss telling me I need to stop spending much time
answering alll these questions and get some work done; The repetitive
spam emails offering to enlarge my teabags. It’s just all too much. I’m
out of here.

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: What do Mudockens use for money? Or do they trade things in
for their cloth and wood or do they make every thing them self’s.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Different tribes do different things. Sometimes it’s
tit-for-tat, sometimes you have to work for your dinner, sometimes
there’s a currency like beads or idols or teabags. That last one may
only be in my dreams.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey alf why doesn’t Abe rhyme anymore like when he
was at Rupture Farms.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Same reason you don’t go around making all your speech rhyme
poetically – it’s a pain in the asterisks.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> why does big face where a mask?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> On his face. Oh sorry, I misread. He wears a mask because it’s
traditional and he’s all about the tradition. That’s why he’s the shaman
and we’re not. Might as well ask why judges wear silly wigs or why I
wear my fez. It’s part of the job and we love it.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> what is it like being abe’s brother? have you two ever done
something silly?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Being Abe’s brother is great. So much better than being Abe.
Having to sneak into smelly factories and hide in the shadows while
trigger-happy Sligs come within a Stingbee’s wing of spotting you? Now
that’s silly, and I love being allowed to sit on the sidelines. Oh come
on, don’t look at me like that! If I get caught, who will be there to
rehabilitate future escapees? I’m too valuable an asset.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Them Clackers were blazin’ a trail across the frontier,
but the frontier of WHAT? Do they come from Mudos, or over the ocean? Do
they have still their own territories, or were they chased outta the
region by nasty imperialist Glukkons?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Where they come from is a mystery. It’s like the changing of
the seasons or the tides of the sea. What matters is that they came
chasing industry and treasure, and they found both.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Two questions. First, are steefs a super species like so many others
on Oddworld? You’d think my momma would have told me, but nooo.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I’m sure my momma would have told me if only I’d ever met her.
Instead she’s locked up in some chamber somewhere being forced to lay
the highest number of Labor Eggs she can manage. You can call it a super
species if you like, but it sure seems to me that putting all your
reproductive eggs in a single basket case is a risky strategy.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Second, if most mudokons are sexless, why do they wear loincloths?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Just because we don’t reproduce doesn’t mean we’re without
modesty. Who’d want to see our little green butts bobbing about the
screen? Actually, let’s pretend I didn’t say that. I know what kind of
place the internet has become during my sabbatical. Look, we just don’t
want our… the top of our legs to get cold.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> why is it that there are no females in oddworld besides he
glukken queen unless it a drrag queen?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There are plenty of females, you just haven’t been looking in
the right places. Take a trip to Western Mudos, there are female
Clakkerz and Grubbs there.
</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> also what do mudoken females look like and where do the eggs come from
thanks alf :)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Mudokon females are big. And I don’t mean like an Amazonian.
The eggs come from them.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf if you had to choose between Abe and Big Face to lead
the mudokons who would you choose?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> As far as I’m aware, we don’t have a single leader and never
have. Big Face is a spiritual leader, although by no means the only one.
Abe is more of a political-slash-military leader. How can I possibly
pick one? I suppose Abe has freed more of us and incited us to fight for
our freedom more than Big Face has. Or maybe Big Face accomplished a
butt-load before Abe and I were even born. I just don’t know. I have a
feeling I’d regret it, but I guss I’d have to go with Abe.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Who is big face and why is he blue like abe???

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Maybe it’s Abe from the future, come back to set the whole
Quintology in motion! Dun dun duuuun!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, would Glukkons bring up the notion of hiring another
species as sadistic peacekeepers just to scare sligs into working
harder?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sligs don’t need to work harder. They’re cheap, expendable, and
they get the job done. True they topple like dumbinoes when Abe’s
barging into the place, but there’s no way of predicting when that will
happen. Better just to hire a few extra personnel to ensure your
personal safety and make do with the insurance when your franchise goes
kablooey. But until that fateful day, Sligs’ incompetance is no match
for their effectiveness.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hey alf! hey why do sligs need all the machinery on them, on
the face, such as the eyes or even the tubes. do they need it because
they have a hard time breathing or seeing or somthing?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Breathing, seeing, speaking, looking attractive enough to not
cause everyone around you to spontaneously erupt in irrepressible
volcanoes of vomit – Sligs have trouble with all of it. They’re just
awfully built creatures, not suited to any kind of skilled or
intelligent work. All their good for is taking their own frustration and
jealousy and turning it into hatred of everyone around them.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey, just a few questions about this chapter in Abe’s life;

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, I suppose that is what I’m here for. Fine, shoot.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 1.) What is the reproductive system of Interns; are they
hermaphrodite’s like Vykkers, have two genders or do they have a
queen?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Uh, I guess whichever of those means they all look the same and
like the same things. The first one. Or the last one. Or any other one.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2.) Why were Intern Shock Rockers cut from the game?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Shock Rockers are a fine idea until you realize that your
Interns are working in metal environments, with co-workers wearing metal
and critter cages that open when a large voltage is delivered to them.
Even if those electrified batons saved a few Interns’ lives from escaped
Fuzzles getting toothy on their captors, dozens more would be lost to
Fuzzle stampedes and accidental electrocutions. The danger is worse in
the sewers of Vykkers Labs, especially during Prune Consumption Week.
That’s why Shock Rockers aren’t around.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 3.) What are Glukkon/Vykker and Slig/Intern relations or Vykker/Slig
and Glukkon/Intern for that matter?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Of those combinations, the only ones that really interact are
Glukkons and Vykkers, and even then only because they have to. Glukkons
and Vykkers are separate industrial families with their own interests.
Sometimes that means cooperating, sometimes that means competing.
Oftentimes it means using Shrinks as less disturbing business
negotiators. Sligs and Interns also come from separate security firms
and probably wouldn’t get along for no more reason than that.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 4.) Will the gabbits die out after the 150 eggs or do they have two
genders?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I doubt the Raisin would have sent Abe and Munch to get the can
if he wasn’t certain it was essential for the survival of the Gabbit
species. I can’t wait to find out what happens when that can opens.
Hopefully it’s eggs and not worms inside.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 5.) Where is Lulu now?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Wherever the desperate, the needy, the poor and the excluded go
when society won’t give them a leg (or arm) to stand on: the street.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I have just been wondering; what is the backstory of Doc? Was he a
Vykker from Vykkers Lab 13? And if so; did he survive the explosion or
leave due to differences? Or from somewhere all together different?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Vykkers Labs is just one business in the Vykkers’ research
armada. Doc never worked there, but he is fully qualified and registered
with whatever quacks you need to qualify and register with to convince
small Clakker townships that you’re a competant medical professional.
Why did he wind up in the middle of nowhere? Somebody’s got to. Maybe he
likes all the roadkill and taxidermy. Maybe he just filled a job
position everyone else was too proud to accept.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hey alf, How come when a mudokon, slig, glukkon, slog and
paramite get crushed by a meat saw or blown up they shatter into pieces,
but scrabs don’t?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Um. They have really tough skin?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Also, Will abe aver travel through an empty meech temple filled with
booby traps set by the tribe’s ancestors to learn a new spiritual power?
sounds cool to me :D

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> What is with all the questions asking me what happens in the
future? I don’t know! How can I possibly know? I’ve never been there,
and even if I had why would I risk destroying the fabric of spacetime by
interfering with it? No, no more. If anyone asks me anything else about
the future I’m just going to fart in their face.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf! I was wondering: Who shall survive in a hypothetical
clash between a scrab and a meech?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Scrab. Meeches are tough, but they could only compete with a
Scrab if they’re in a pack. Note that Meeches are always in a pack. Not
any more, obviously. Extinction puts a real crimp in your social life.
Just ask Munch.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was just wondering, Was it true whats on wikipedia
about there nearly being a lawsuit in japan about abe and his friends
having 4 fingers? and that the game was altered to have only 3 fingered
abe? Thanks alot!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It wasn’t a lawsuit, it was extortion. They didn’t want
four-fingered characters to be shown in the country for historical
cultural reasons. That might be perfectly alright except they were
willing to compromise their own rule if they were paid enough. They were
using a very dark part of their country’s past to profit, and we weren’t
cool with that. So instead of giving them the cash, we gave them the
finger.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf, What IS the password for Packrat Palooka’s hideout?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I’m looking in the original script and apparently it’s “String
of short and long beeps to indicate censored vulgarity”. That sound
right?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Alf, I know that the subject of cloning is two months ago, but
I want to address this subject if it’s not too much trouble. I also knew
that cloning will have some benefits, such as replacing inefficient
organs and organ systems and bringing extinct creatures back to life;
however, if the Vykkers invented cloning, then there is a chance that
the Glukks and the Vykkers might clone Mudokons without their knowledge
or conscent. With all this information in mind, what is your view of
Mudokon cloning?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Cloning Mudokons is a horrific and detestable idea. The only
families with the technology to do that are the ones who will use the
clones for nothing good. Imagine the scale of torture and mistreatment,
the terror and suffering that will ensue. Imagine the power of their war
machine if it’s powered by millions of cheap-to-replace Mudokons.
Imagine how disposable we’ll all become.

But I wouldn’t mind being cloned. Then I’d only have to a fraction of
the work.

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: you know why Strenger has no horns?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Why yes I do, but it’s not my place to talk about it behind his
back. He’s a grown bounty hunter, he can answer for himself.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf! I have read in your previous FAQs that Grubbs and
Mudokons are not related at all, and do not follow the same evolutionary
path. I’ve also read that the Gabbits (used to) spawn in the Mongo River
in Western Mudos, where the Grubbs live. Are Gabbits and Grubbs related?
If not, did they in the same region or villages?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They’re not related, just like you’re not related to fish
(unless my audience has changed drastically in the last few months), but
they do have a fascinating relationship. Gabbits are revered by all
native inhabitants of the Mongo River and the surrounding land. Their
annual return to spawn is a major event in the yearly lives of everyone
there.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> In Mudos, are there computers and the internet?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There sure are, but don’t expect to see many in the sweat
shops, unexplored wilderness or emerging colonies. Sure the occassional
egg-head Clakker uses his laptop to operate town security, but the most
tech you’ll ever see outside of the consumer cities are in the Vykkers’
twisted research facilities.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do you know English as a second language? Or do you just translate our
questions into some Mudokon / Oddworld language and read and reply to
them?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yes, I read and reply to as many questions as I can. Not always
in good time, but a Mud tries his hardest.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Are there any other planets in the Oddwordian star system that sustain
life? If you don’t know, I think you should ask a Vykker, I heard it on
the SpooceVine that they are into astronomy!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Vykkers astronomy isn’t a patch on ancient Mudokon star-gazing.
If you want the celestial truth, check out our oldest calendars and
prophecies. Don’t ask me where you can find them. The shamans keep such
knowledge safely away from common view.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 1. Is hand of odd coming out this year?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Nope! Hand of Odd is an ambitious project, and it will take
long enough just to decide what exactly we want from it.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2. do the people of oddworld know earth exists.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Why would we want to know about Earth when we’re already so
wrapped up in our own problems?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 3. have people traveled into space, gone to the mudokon moon maybe.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Space travel? You mean with the big-headed, gray-skinned beings
and their unsolicited slicing and dicing? Yeah, right. This ain’t
sci-fi, bub!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 4.are fleeches and slurgs used as food?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Slurgs are massively harvested for protein products. Fleeches
are mostly used as Glukkon pets, but a wandering Mudokon pilgrim can’t
be fussy about his dinner, and properly prepared Fleech meat isn’t
entirely unpalatable.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> if abe is blue because he is sad..then why is he sad??? :c i
want to make him feel better

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You’re asking me why Abe is sad as though you haven’t seen
what’s happening to him and his people. He’s a sensative fellah, and the
fate of his race is kinda an emotional thing. No need to be surprised or
shocked. Just be there if he ever needs a shoulder to cry his delicious
tears on.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> what are some of the other Mudokon deitys? You lot seem too nice
and peaceful just have Shrykull, a god of Revenge.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Shrykull isn’t a god of revenge. Shrykull represents the
duality of nature, the balance of creation and destruction, love and
hate, up and down, left and right, salt and pepper, pride and prejudice,
and so on. Imagine you’re responsible for all that when some Glukkons
parade onto your turf and start dismantling all your carefully-managed
world with their slash-and-burn capitalism. You’d be out for revenge
too!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> dear alf where do mudokons go after you save them through the
bird portal??? i await your reply!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They go to wherever the bird portal leads. Usually this is to
the Monsaic Sanctum, where rescued Mudokons can be introduced to their
newfound freedom and ancient heritage. Sometimes to other, more local
safehouses. Don’t question the birds! I’m not convinced they wouldn’t
teleport you high into the atmosphere and laugh at you with their wings
as you plummet back down to Oddworld.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hey alf what happend to that blind mudokon that hit his hand
with a hammer while tring to nail in your sign

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> He’s now the village hammerer.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What was going through your mind when you started drinking
Soulstorm Brew? I mean, it is made out of Mudokon bones and tears. Why
would you drink that? That’s like if you made tea with a secret
ingredient that turned out to be Mudokon blood. It’s just morbid.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Why! Why must you torture me! Of course we didn’t know what was
in it! You think they print it on the label? “Ingredients: Your
ancestors”??? It was hot, we were tired, and in case you didn’t notice,
we’d just walked across a desert! How can you begrudge us thirst?? Don’t
you think we feel bad enough already?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What are the native Mudokon beliefs in the afterlife, if any?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Too numerous to mention! But they mostly agree on the existence
of a spirit world, separate but connected to our own. It’s the goal of
shamans to come to know and understand this spirit world by studying the
animals and plants that intuitively intersect it. One of these plants is
the SpooceShrub.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was a member and visitor of the old Oddworld site and used to
talk and ask questions there. I even got a Oddworld birthday card a few
years back. I love all the Oddworld games so far and the Oddworld
universe. Hey, does the old site still exist?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It’s been preserved by some of our dedicated fans. [Check it
out](http://oddworldlibrary.net/archives/web/oddworld.com/).
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do fleeches communicate with each other like paramites?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No, they communicate with each other like Fleeches.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> And will fleeches return in future Oddworld games and will Abe be able
to possess them? It would be awesome to use them to kick slig ass with
or just to experiment.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Maybe. Fleeches aren’t really known for their intellectual
capacity. But Abe started squeezing his mind into smaller and smaller
brains, even Slogs! So, perhaps.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What does Brew sickness feel like? What are the
symptoms?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It feels like the world is spinning and the air is shouting and
your body will go flinging off into the distance if you move. So stay
close to the ground, shut out everything you see and hear, and wait to
fart it out of your system.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> After Abe cured you guys of Brew sickness in Abe’s Exoddus, did you
guys still feel a craving for Brew, thus inspiring you to start your
rehab facility?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Yes, of course! It’s called addiction, and you have to manage
it carefully to stop it controlling your life. SoulStorm Brew is
designed to be hugely addictive, and if you can control its supply, you
can control its addicts. It’s one of the biggest and best ways to
suppress people’s desires for freedom, in Oddworld and your world. But
no, I’m totally over Brew now. Couldn’t care less about it. Stay out of
my refridgerator!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I saw that picture of a woodcarving of a Scubatoad that somebody
posted on Twitter, but what exactly are Scubatoads? Are they a Native
species or a wildlife species?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Scuba Toads are native creatures. We haven’t seen them because
they’re fantastically ellusive. If we could lure them out into the open
and convince them to fight for our common cause, who knows what we could
accomplish. Maybe very little. Maybe an awful lot.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> In Abe’s Oddysee, in the cell where Abe is being held, somebody
scrawled the words “Molluck sucks” on the wall. Do you know who wrote
that phrase and what became of him (the person who wrote it, I mean – I
know exactly what happens to Molluck)?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I’m a good Mud! I never got sent to a detention cell. That
graffiti could have been anybody’s. I can guess what happened to them,
but I don’t want to ruin your appetite.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> In the instruction manual for Abe’s Oddysey, Sligs were described as
having “room-temperature I.Q.’s.” Does this mean that their I.Q. is
dependent on the temperature of the room that they’re in, or is this a
different way of saying that Sligs are naturally stupid? (Don’t tell
Crig that I said this!)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You tell me.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> And finally, you mentioned in a previous entry of Dear Alf that Slurgs
weren’t measured in feet; they were measured in decibels. So, what is
the average decibel rating of a Slurg popping underfoot?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> 100!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Have you ever been to or seen Nolybab? What is it
like?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I’d love to go to Nolybab one day. The big city, the bright
lights, the towering buildings, the sheer scale of shopping
opportunities! The gum-encrusted walkways, the flickering neon, the
pushing, the shoving, the shrieking, the spitting. Actually, I’ve put
myself off the whole thing. Nolybab can go sink into the crust of the
planet for all I care.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Do the Glukkons make food from bees and bats too ?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Not directly. Bees and bats may number in the billion across
the planet, but they’re such small and fiddly things. Not much meat.
Bees are only good for honey, all packed into overcrowded apiaries
towering high and covering entire fields. Breed them without wings, just
pump the raw materials into the hive. When the combs are full, crush the
whole lot and sort the honey from the waste afterwards. At least, that’s
how I’d do it if I were a soulless capitalist.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Can Rupture Farms produce its own energy ?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It does! There’s no power hookup out in the wastelands. Its
mighty furnaces and boilers churned fuel into fire into power day in,
day out. Had its own emergency backup, too. Very sophisticated setup.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Have you ever met Aslik, Dripik and Phleg ?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No, I never had the ‘pleasure’.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf! I have a few questions if you don’t mind answering
them. If possible, could I get semi-serious answers? I know you’re a
humorous guy, but I’m a big Oddworld fan that would love to know more
about your homeworld!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I’ll have you know that all my answers are serious! Except the
silly ones, but those are my favorites. You don’t like the silly
answers? You might be writing to the wrong columnist.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 1) Are Outlaws and Wolvarks related species?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Outlaws are many species. They’ve banded together to do the
best they can after their cultures were destroyed. It wouldn’t surprise
me to learn that a few Wolvarks were amongst them.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2) Are Outlaws and Wolvarks native to Mudos or are they settlers?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> All the species we’ve seen so far are native to Mudos. Some of
them we call settlers, like the Clakkerz, come from a different part of
Mudos, but still Mudos. There is one exception, and that’s the Almighty
Raisin, who comes from far, far to the north.

Q. 3) Will we ever learn more about the Steef, Wolvarks, Interns,
Outlaws, Clakkerz, Kinto and Chroniclers?

</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 4) Is there any interaction between the Oktigi species and Glukkons?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> On a business level, lots. Oktigi are very rich and very
powerful, and many a Glukkon venture wouldn’t be able to start up
without their investment. On a personal level, none. Oktigi keep
themselves to themselves, are very secretive and never trust outsiders.
The details of their culture are one of the most closely guarded secrets
on Oddworld.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 5) Are the Brain Slurgs (Squeek’s species) humanoid like Abe or a more
exotic species?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well they’re Slurgs, so I guess they’re small, squigey and
about 100 decibels.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 6) What is the connection between the Magog Cartel and Uggae Estate?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hierarchical!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 7) Will there ever be a Munch’s Exoddus?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> See question 3.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 8) Are they any free Mudokons who have embraced industrial society and
that aren’t slaves?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> That very much depends how you’re defining slavery. There are
those that aren’t considered the properity of CEOs, whose lives are
legally their own, but with so much addiction, advertising and
misinformation going on in so-called Civilized society, I would hardly
say that they are ‘free’.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 9) Which industrial races are foreign to Mudos? I remember that
Glukkons, Oktigi and Sligs are Mudos natives, but I’ve read nothing
about the Vykkers, Interns, Wolvarks, Clakkerz or Outlaws belong to
Mudos.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I think you already asked this question.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 10) Also in FeeCo Depot there is a poster that says “Pack Your Bags”
and shows a sunny beach with a big city near it. What is that place? Is
it located on Mudos or somewhere else in Oddworld?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Probably just a painting of some Civilized concept of an
oddyllic holiday destination. Don’t let the adverts trick you into
thinking FeeCo will deliver you to any desirable destination.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hey Alf what do sligs have to do to become Big Bros do they
evolve or something? help me out here

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Big Bros are what happens when you take an ordinary
crawl-of-the-mill Slig and pump it full of steroids. Note the bulging
muscles, wide neck, gargantuan size and observable bigness. A Slig can
buy its own steroid treatments if it ever earns that much Moolah, but
it’s quicker for a CEO to stump up the cash for the improved security.
</p>
</div>

looked it up and came empty handed can u help me out here?

<p><b>Question:</b> Q: Who is the shirink angel,or guarden angel of abe?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Depends. On one level, you are the guardian angel of Abe!
You’re the ones who determine whether he’ll make each jump, dodge each
bullet or rescue each slave. You’re the one with complete power over
him. You’re the one struggling with the ethical dilemmas and challenging
situations. But I think you mean the ‘Shrink’ character that appeared
briefly in an unaired TV ad for Abe’s Oddysee. Shrinks are the product
of Vykkers AI technicians, completely self-aware machines that take on
the responsibilities of corporate negotiation and employee psychologist.
Unfortunately, their need to empathise with their patients drove Vykkers
scientists to introduce a bug: a sense of self-preservation. Too bad for
those mechanical spider things that their survival hinges on the same
ceiling rails that they do.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was rampaging my way through Paramite Run the other day
and I saw a large meaty skeleton decaying in a clearing. I didn’t get a
close look, as those Paramites pack a mighty fierce wallop and I had ta’
scurry. So what on Odd was that thing?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Just the inedible remains of some poor beast that wandered into
the valley, or chased into it by those tactical Paramites. Hey, maybe it
was a Meech!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> i know i could probably find the information somewhere on the
internet but who is the mastermind who created the spectacular
melancholic sceneries of oddworld?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> In a visionary sense, the name you’re after is Lorne Lanning,
our alliterative creator and mentor. The actual environments are the
product of so many people’s input I couldn’t begin to name them all.
From the concept designers to the digital artists to the envirnomental
modellers and level designers. Check out the game credits.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hi Alf. have you ever met some bad Mudokons or/and good Sligs
out there?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> ‘Good’ and ‘bad’ are just words. What matters is what you do.
Would you call a Mudokon bad if he sliced up his people’s holy
creatures, bought and ate unhealthy snacks made out of them, was
addicted to Brew and was generally lazy and naive? You’ve just described
me and Abe and all our buddies, at least at some point in time. I’m not
sure what would count as a good Slig. They’re not evil, crikey I’ve
laughed alongside them at times, usually when Abe tripped over
something. They’re just institutionalized bullies. With bloodlust. And
guns.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was just thinking about a few things…
1. What was the Slig race like before Glukkons started using them for
security purposes?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Like they are now, but without the firepower or mobility:
weaseley cowards with no creative thought or craftsmanship, jealous of
everyone around them. At least they wouldn’t have been Brew addicts, but
they probably didn’t wash as much either.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2. Are there any native Glukkons or Sligs about anymore on Oddworld?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No, they’re both entirely entrenched in civilized society, and
have been for centuries, with not the slightest vestige of their
ancestral culture. If they ever had any in the first place.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 3. Finally, how do slogs/paramites/scrabs navigate? Do they use some
kind of sonar navigation like bats? Thanks :-)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Not everyone relies on vision. Slogs have amazing hearing,
while Paramites rely on their keen sense of smell. I’m convinced Scrabs
navigate using sheer sense of hunger.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Why don’t Gluckons have legs????

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> They do! Next question!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Thanks for answering my question officially Alf.
Anyways, I was wondering about Oddworld’s wildlife: so far, almost every
living thing we find in the games tries to kill us; be it sligs, scrabs,
paramites, fleeches, or the dreaded accursed death bat of doom. I was
wondering if there are any nice little docile critters that would make
good pets. I mean, maybe fuzzles but you can’t forget to feed them
O\_O.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sure there are more timid and docile creatures, it’s just that
they normally run and hide before you can catch a glimpse of them. The
larger ones have probably all been chopped up by now. So what are you
looking to give a good home? A jittery Stunk or a chatty Chippunk?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Hello Alf, I was wondering if you were a free mudokon, or were
you ever in slavery.( Such as mining in Necrum or worked at Rupture
Farms, etc.)

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I was hatched a slave in RuptureFarms and worked from birth
till I was 15. Many of friends were disfigured or killed by machinery,
others were beaten to death and still more were simply exhausted of
life. On the plus side, we got a yummy snack treat every week or so.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, a couple of questions, if I may. During Abe’s
adventures, we often saw him die, often gruesomly, only to come back
later with his body and memories intact. With enough spooce, he could
even bring others back to life. So, does that make mudokons immortal, as
long as there’s someone to bring them back? Are there really no side
effects to this (except obvious, like emotional trauma)?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I wouldn’t take what you saw in Munch’s Oddysee as the absolute
truth. After all, you were seeing the world through the eyes of Abe and
Munch, and did you see how much Spooce those two got through that day??
It’s a wonder they weren’t running from hallucinated dragons or trying
to clamber up the side of rainbows. Sometimes the recently deceased can
be resurrected, but only as shuffling, brain dead Mudombies, and it’s
not the kind of thing a kind-hearted person goes about doing. Those poor
souls. Besides, you seem to be implying that Abe led his friends to
death, which I can assure you he never did.

And secondly, what happens to mudokons while they’re in the Great
Beyond? Do they wander the Oddworld like incorporeal spirits, or do they
go to some completely different place, like land of eternal peace and
endless tea? Do they just stay there if no one brings them back, or do
they eventually reincarnate into newborn mudokons, or non-mudokons?
Mudokonian afterlife, what is it like?

You show me your afterlife, I’ll show you mine.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Anyway, i was wondering do mudokons naturally have stitches on
their mouths, or were they put on by somone else?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Mudokons are fitted with stitches by considerate Glukkon
managers concerned about what’s going into their delicate workers, and
sometimes what’s coming out of them. If you don’t want the horrific
sight of cultural cannibalism and ancestral bodysnatching going into
your miners’ eyes, you stitch ’em up. If you don’t want your taskforce
to complain about the loud working conditions of cleaning heavy
machinery, you sew their ears shut. And if you’re worried productivity
will plummet when your butchers banter across their chopping boards, you
make sure their lips don’t part more than they need to guzzle down that
late night Brew and early morning Java.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> what dose Molluck the Glukkon look like now

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Do you have ‘barbecue’ where you come from?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> what doses the Glukkon queen look like

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, she’s very old and poorly preserved, highly accessorized
in exquisite jewelry, her face is contorted by more than a century’s
regal sneering and executive stress… oh, and she’s too big to move by
herself.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What’s it like being friends with Abe?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It’s an absolute pleasure you’ll never know. Haha. I’m joshing,
Abe’s a real friendly guy and it’s great to be buds with him. I’ll
always be there to give him a helping hand and encouraging pat on the
back. I just wish he didn’t pass quite so much wind, ya know?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What ever happened to Abe and Munch after Munches oddysee
.There has to be more Gluckens trying to use mudockins as slaves.Or
something odd that they can fight.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Sure thing, but that hasn’t happened yet.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> So what happend to munches race? Were they turnd into cakes like
scrabs or turned into pies like paramites?Or turned into Gabbit feet on
a stick!So please tell me when you read this.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> What didn’t happen to Munch’s race? Gabbits are famed for their
versatility of product, from their waterproof skin to their high-protein
flesh. They are popular lab critters, but they can fetch a staggering
price for their Gabbiar or Gabbit Fin Soup. And of course their lungs
are just perfect replacements for Glukkons’.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Dear Alf, i am a big fan i have seen and heard alot about you i
was wondering if you were ever the main character of a oddworld game and
is it fun being in oddworld

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Hey, you don’t have to star in your own videogame to be a hit
celebrity! If that were the case then Terry The Fifth Slurg From Left
would never have made his big break in advertising!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Say Alf, I notice when Abe blows something up he always falls
but if there is another Mudokon on the screen they don’t fall. Does Abe
have a balancing issue?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> How interesting. It seems that Abe must be capable of
attracting all the shock waves from explosions towards himself,
presumably to protect other Mudokons from harm. I can’t think of any
other explanation.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was once (and hope to soon be once again) an intrepid
explorer of all that is Oddworld. I know that there will soon be a time
for me to return to lands previously visited, thanks to Science and
Water (Just Add it!). My question is, is there a possibility of visiting
any new and undiscovered lands (within the World of Odd) in my future?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Unexplored regions of Oddworld abound! Just hop on a FeeCo
Train, hitch a lift with a Meetle, or hurl yourself face-first into your
nearest travel well. If you want a little less mystery to your
destination, you could always get a Mudokon guide, but you generally
have to earn their trust and respect before they’ll trample through the
forest by your side. One day I’m sure we’ll explore the uncharted
mountaintops, stagnant swamps, tropical beaches, volcanic jungles and
sprawling toxic wastelands of Oddworld. It’s a huge planet, it’d be hard
not to find something new.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> p.s. The Doctor likes both Stetsons and Fez’. (They’re Cool!) you two
aren’t acquainted are you?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I’ve never been to the Mongo River Valley, and I certainly
wouldn’t go and see Doc.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What do you think about the fact that Abe turns some of your
lazy sleeping, tea drinking Mudokon friends into Slig killing Warriors?
Is the personality change big when interacting with them? And after
becoming Warriors, do they tend to visit your Rehab less likely, more
likely or all the same? Thank you, come again.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There’s no reason at all a promotion should change the
personality of its recipient. When Abe “upgrades” his pals from
unenthused weaklings to armed fighters, it’s true, he’s giving them the
confidence in themselves to stop sitting on their blue butts and start
taking a stand against their enemies, but that’s a natural consequence
of empowerment, not some artificial personality change delivered by
mystic lightning. Once they’re warriors I suppose they drink less tea,
but only because they’re keeping themselves busy, not because they’re
switching to Brew or anything. In other words, relax! The customs of our
people might look strange to you, but there’s no need to worry. We’re
perfectly sensible level headed. Now, I need to get ready for my cheese
rolling match.

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: dear alf who would win in an arm wrestling contest you or
abe

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> My dear Joseph, it would be no contest. Out of Abe and myself,
only one of us spends all day stirring tea.

Q. dear alf what do gabbit eggs taste like

</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> ok some things i wanted to ask  
1.)why didn’t anyone recognize Stranger as a Steef? It’s not like he
bothered to disguise his face.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You’re telling me if you saw someone going around with a lion’s
face, you’d recognize them as a lion even though they only had two
legs? Yeah, right. Blow your other trumpet.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 2.)For the first half of the game, Stranger had his hind legs and rear
bound up against his forelegs. This seems incredibly painful — walking
with the entirety of his lower body folded double against him.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> This isn’t a question, how did it end up here?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> 3.)Why does the Outlaw that captures Stranger make a big deal of the
fact that he was the one who captured Blisterz Booty? Wasn’t Booty a
small fry?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Blisterz Booty was once a member of D. Caste Raider’s clan, but
became ambitious and badass enough to start his own gang. When he got
taken out by Stranger, his remaining followers moved back in with
Raider. Make sense now?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I really was looking forward to meeches lol will they draw
any with colors couse I like how the meeches look like and are they wild
or are they cowards?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Are they wild or are they cowards?? I can’t even think how
you came up with that dichotomy. They were wildlife for certain. You’d
be wild too if you were made extinct. In fact, you could say they were
pretty cut up about it.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> hey alf are there any good outlaws in oddworld and what types of
food do mudokons eat i would be suprised if all of the natives live on
your tea!

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> If they were good, they wouldn’t be called ‘outlaws’, now would
they. They’d be called ‘inlaws’, which is whole different kind of
not-good. Mudokons eat all sorts: fruits we pick, crops we grow, meat we
kill, milk we… well, milk.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Just something that’s been bothering me: In Abe’s
Oddysee and Exodus, you had those Mudokons who would give you powers
(e.g. blow up everything red ring of death power). Why’d they ask you
for a password? These things only seemed to blow up industrials (Wait,
second question, why?), so they couldn’t hurt him. It seems silly
somehow.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> As a test of Abe’s worthiness. If Abe isn’t well versed in
Mudokon scripture, culture and, uh, whistling then he’s not worth
helping.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Thanks for the replies, Alf. I nearly ran out of questions,
but after some thought I’ve come up with more:

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Oh thank the Odd!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Is Munch carnivorous? I assume he eats fish since he’s aquatic but I’m
not too sure. I would ask the same for Stranger but he seems to like
cornbread so, I’m gonna assume he’s omnivorous.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Did you not see the opening sequence where the Gabbits are
eating fish?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> And, how is that retired sleg hunter doing? When talking to Clakkerz I
usually have the melee button ready, but he turned out to be pretty
helpful. I even spoke to him after the bounty and he wasn’t a jerk about
it.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Last I heard, he was thinking about taking up hunting again. If
you ask me, he’s a bit over the hill to be doing that, but since Lefty
Lugnutz screwed up the population numbers so much, it shouldn’t be too
bad a job. Especially since the whole place is now deep underwater.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Abe is a different colour to most Mudokons,and that sligs beat
him up for it,but how did Abe become that colour,was it an acciedent? or
on purpose?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> How do humans become different colors? Accidentally, or do you
do it on purpose?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> dear alf did you and abe ever get in a fight

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> You again? What is it with you and trying to get me and Abe to
fight?
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Speaking of Elums, how have those creatures been
recently?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Smelly.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Never really thought about it much beyond “useful thing for
mudokons” but now I wonder if there’s anything more interesting about
the properties of Spooce you could share with us? For example, is it a
vegetable? Some kind of mushroom? Are they all green, all year round?
And so on…

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Spooce is a magical and mystical substance that bestows mojo
and moxie. SpooceShrubs are just one source. SpooceShrubs are, I
suppose, comparable to your Earthly mushrooms. They like well-hydrated,
unpolluted land in general, but there are so many varieties it’s not
worth me covering the full range of colors, habitats and lifecycles they
demonstrate.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> I was wondering: Do any Mudokons study Astronomy? If there are,
do you know about any of the other planets orbiting the celestial body
that Mudos is orbiting?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> There are Mudokon myths and calendars and cults and ceremonies
dedicated to the stars and the skies, but a lot of it is forgotten lore,
tribe-specific or shrouded in secrecy. I for one have more pressing
concerns than what other things are whizzing about the sun.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Also are there any sporting events that you and Abe go see together.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> We don’t have the big, corporate sports teams you might be used
to. Our games are friendly and inclusive and casual. Abe and I do watch
the hunters on some of their more ceremonial returns to praise their
effort and success.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> dear alf what is the all mighty raisin

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The Almighty Raisin is a millennia-old sage who has aided more
civilizations than I can name, but is now basically a dozy and
dessicated stump. Please don’t tell anyone I said that!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> will we ever git to see a sligs face

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I sure hope we never have to endure that.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> what is strangers real name

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I think I heard someone call him Steve, but I might have
misheard. But the fact is, no one really knows, hence the term
“Stranger”. DUH!

<div><h2><a id="interview-with-alf"></a>interview-with-alf<br>(Posted on: 01/2005)</h2><center><a href="#toc">Back to the top</a></center><br>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Q: What is the expected game play length of this game for an
average game player?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> We’re estimating it at 12-15 hours, but obviously that is going
to vary quite a bit not only with skill level, but just in how people
would prefer to play – there’s a lot of room to “play it your way.”
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> When I was at Oddworld Studios earlier this year, I managed
to play some of the levels as they were at the time. Has there been much
change in how the gameplay and enviornments have changed from six months
ago, and if so, what improvements were implimented?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Wow, six months ago… it seems like forever! One thing I can
think of that has changed is the ammo. It went through a lot of
revisions. It is a really important part of the game and we wanted it to
be exactly as we intended. It started out a little too cutesy for our
taste so we toughened it up a little, added the upgrades, and gave the
player one infinite ammo, the Zappflies. You’ll used these to hunt other
ammo, and you can use them on enemies as well.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What prompted the change in title from "Oddworld Stranger"
to "Oddworld Stranger's Wrath"?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> A couple of things, really. First of all the previous naming
conventions were a very specific pattern… Come on, say it with me now:
Oddworld, colon, character’s name, then insert clever word that
represents a journey. Kinda predictable, so we decided we wanted to keep
the same “ring” to it and maintain that way of identifying with
Oddworld, but come a little closer to center without all the made-up
spellings and such. On the other hand we got whiff of some other titles
that were similar to what we’d previously had in mind and preferred to
not cause any confusion. One thing Oddworld is not keen on is being
“just like” anything else… so we sort of avoid that at all costs!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What kind of promotions are being planned for the game, such
as advertising and other promotions as the release date draws nearer?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, first of all you may have noticed a brand new site at
http://www.oddworld.ea.com. It’s a gorgeous piece, I must say, I really
like it. Also online, you’ll find great Oddworld features at
gamespot.com and developer diaries at
http://xbox.gamespy.com/xbox/oddworld-4/572191p1.html. A print ad has
also recently been in some recent pubs, like OXM. I’ve also been privy
to some cool online promos, and of course, the crème de la crème, the
piece de resistance, is that pre-order dvd. It is just awesome. I’m not
bragging, really, it is just really cool, even as old Alfie, to see all
those Oddworld movies and random clips all in one place, together, where
they belong, on one handy-dandy dvd. Getting it all on there was no easy
task, and it is probably the most comprehensive Oddworld item we’ve ever
put together. Well, since The Art of Oddworld Inhabitants (available at
www.ballisticpublishing.com). This is really an exciting time for us and
for the fans, with the book and the dvd being available just before the
launch of Oddworld Stranger’s Wrath. It just seems like two things we’ve
always wanted have finally come to fruition… I hope that the fans enjoy
it as much as us!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Where on Oddworld is this game set? Is it set on Mudos or on
another continent altogether?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The game takes place in Mudos but not in the same region that
Abe and Munch are from. So you’ll see some familiar species, but for the
most part it is a whole new cast and location.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Relating to the above question, at what part of the Oddworld
timeline does the game take place? Is it set before/after the Abe/Munch
games, or in a totally different time period?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Wow, that is a great question. The story is really completely
separate, so the time, in relation to the Abe and Munch games is really
sort of irrelevant. However, if we did put them in chronological order,
for whatever reason, I would say it is after. We haven’t ripped a hole
in the fabric of time or anything.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Apart from the obvious FPS and action/adventure genres in
the game, the game appears to incorporate some elements of the RPG
gentre \[purchasing and upgrading of ammo, stores, talking to
townspeople, sidequests, etc\]. What influenced these to be included in
the game and do you see Oddworld bringing other RPG elements into their
games or expanding on this in the future?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Fun. That’s it. We wanted this game to be fun, entertaining,
enjoyable… on top of everything else. The upgrades add a lot to the
gameplay experience, and our designers had a blast coming up with the
purchasable items, as well as HOW they are purchased. I’m not sure what
the future holds, if that will become a bigger influence. We are always
interested in trying new and different things, so it may be. It would be
great to incorporate some online elements in that way.
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Stranger's Wrath production has been very secret. What are the
pros and cons of this for you?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> It has its good points and its bad… I think there was more
creative freedom, but also the price of falling off the industry radar
for a while, not to mention our poor fans being kept in the proverbial
dark. Things are picking up now though, and so far the strategy (if you
want to call it that) seems to have benefited us. I think it has created
a bit of a stir and some anticipation, and hopefully, if all goes well,
people will be pleasantly surprised with all we’ve packed into this
game. We think it’s worth the wait!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> What innovations in the game do you think other developers
will follow?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> In general, I guess we hope that all developers keep pushing
the capabilities of the hardware across the board, because everyone
benefits. Certainly innovation is constricted by time, but we still feel
strongly about what we’ve done with this engine. The camera has a really
good feel to it, and the transition between first and third person is
smooth. There’s a depth of field device that allows for some cool camera
effects as well… these are some things you’ll likely be seeing more of
in the future, from us and maybe other developers.

<p><b>Question:</b> Overall, how much has Stranger stayed intact compared to
beginning of production?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Well, the story has been through many iterations, as well as
some of the features. But I think we’ve held true to what was most
important to us, and that is the feel of the in-game cinematics, the
quality of the CG, the entertainment value and the challenge of the
gameplay and our wicked live ammo!

<p><b>Question:</b> Who's your favorite new character appearing in Oddworld:
Stranger's Wrath?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I have to say it’s the Clakkerz. Particularily the females…
it’s the first time we’ve had female characters in the game and frankly,
I enjoy their sense of humor and admire their ability to offend in a
cowardly, cranky sort of way. Remind you of anyone? ; )
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> Favorite environment?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I guess I love the snowy locales. Probably because it
stimulates more senses than sight, you’ll want to shiver when you see
it! BRRRR!!!!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> . Will the game have a "bad ending" like previous installations
of the Oddworld series?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Nope, the end is the end is the end and that’s it. But then you
get the sense that it’s not the end, so, there ya go. This is my best
attempt at luring you to get the game and play it to the end!

<p><b>Question:</b> Oddworld games usually have a valuable message woven within
the story. Abe dealt with slavery and Munch with animal testing. What
issue does Stranger deal with?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> All of our characters deal with lots of issues, that is what
makes them compelling. Not to nit pick, but Abe and Munch were
confronted with slavery and animal testing, AND MORE! Stranger will also
deal with many issues.. I think the difference is that some of his are
more personal. But the big “theme issue” for this game is water
privatization. Sekto Springs Bottled Water Company has dammed the river
to bottle water… and in the process damned the inhabitants that have
relied on it for centuries.

<p><b>Question:</b> Stranger is the only guy to have a story separate from the
Quintology. Do you know of any plans for another character besides
Stranger having this kind of setup?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> I don’t know of any plans specifically, but I do know that when
Abe was “born,” he was the only guy to have a story at that time. I
think in a nutshell, Lorne has lots of ideas and stories to share, and
some of them are a part of the Quintology… but others aren’t. There is
more to come for Stranger, and there are also more heroes to be born.

<p><b>Question:</b> Will the game include any Cheat Codes or Easter Eggs? Possibly
secret Live Ammo? Personally, I think Fleeches would make an awesome
addition to Stranger's arsenal.

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> Fleeches? Great, but messy! You see they slobber so much…..
Anyway, if I told you there were Easter Eggs, they wouldn’t really be
Easter Eggs anymore, now would they? Well maybe, but I need a clever way
out of this question…
</p>

<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> When watching a demo of Stranger on the Internet, it looked to
me that the player would trigger checkpoints like in Halo. Is this true?
What happened to Quicksave?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> The game has quicksaves just like the previous Oddworld games.
We also do autosaves as you play through the game; this is just to help
the forgetful gamer who doesn't hit the save button very often - we
don't want them to have to replay the whole level when they die!
</p>
</div>
<div class='qna'>
<p><b>Question:</b> And one final question just for you. Are you going to make
an appearance?

</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Alf:</b> No, that stranger has his own dressing room, a personal
assistant and gets a latte delivered every morning. I guess I’m sort of
the Hollywood has been of Oddworld. My tummy is a little too poochy, my
eyes not as perky as they once were, and face it, who wants to see an
aging Mudokon in a loincloth when there’s a hunky stranger strutting
around?
