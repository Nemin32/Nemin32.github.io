# Dear Alf, Please Get Your Facts Together!

"Dear Alf" was a several years long series of weekly Q&A-s in which
OWI answered some of the fans' questions in an in-universe format.

While some of these can still be accessed over at [Oddworld's
page](https://oddworld.com), a lot can only be accessed at obscure
archives, so I took the task upon myself to gather every single one of
these I can find and put them in a single page, which you can find
below.

Sadly I still can't guarantee that this is every single question and
answer ever given, but it is still be the large majority of them.

<div id="root">
</div>

<style>
#root {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    width: 70%;
    margin: 1rem auto;
}

#root div {
    padding-top: 1rem;
    padding-left: 3rem;
    padding-right: 3rem;
    margin-bottom: 2rem;
    background: #d2d2d2;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}

#root div div {
    padding-left: 2rem;
    padding-right: 2rem;
    padding-top: 1rem;
    padding-bottom: 1rem;
}
</style>
