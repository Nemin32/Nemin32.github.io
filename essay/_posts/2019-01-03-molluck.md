# A few thoughts on Molluck

_While I was striving to retell the lore here as accurately as possible,
please don't take anything here that isn't sourced or you don't absolutely know
is canon as fact. Enjoy!_

Today I'd like to talk a bit about the big bad, the "meanest boss in the world",
the guy whose malicious intentions you don't need to be told about, Molluck the
Glukkon.

Playing only Abe's Oddysee and Abe's Exoddus and not having cared about the
intended storyline of Munch's Oddysee, one might think that he's really the top
of the foodchain, hell maybe even the owner of the Magog Cartel. The truth is
more complex than this and it might be surprising to some. Molluck is in fact
the prodigal son of [Lady Margaret](trial.html)[^1], the actual current owner of the cartel.  The
Glukkon queen gave the task of running RuptureFarms (along with a few other factories,
we'll get to that) as a test to Molluck to prove his worth before he gets an
actually large turf.

While you might think that RuptureFarms is the "biggest meat processing
plant on Oddworld", it's not, Abe only says this, because he is so
sheltered from the outside world. The number part in RF1029 is not a
codeword, it's a serial number, meaning the factory has more than a
thousand brethren. And while it might seem huge to us, Oddworld has ten
times as much surface area as Earth so even a "smaller" factory like RF is,
is multiple times larger than the largest ones on Earth.

In fact, Mudos (the continent where all the currently released titles
take place) is actually kind of a paralell to Africa, with backwater
factories (like the ones we visit in Oddysee and Exoddus) that employ - and
exploit - the less developed natives. This is why it is a huge shock to the
cartel that a Mudokon-uprising could actually bring down a factory. It's
about as believeable to the Investors and senior members like a group of
tribals with spears and warpaint winning against a modern army.

I mentioned other facilities, so let's continue with that. This might
not be a surprise to some, but I think it's important to point out that
Molluck was behind everything we've seen in the first two games. Not only
did he own RuptureFarms, he's also the boss of the Glukkon trio seen in
Abe's Exoddus and the owner of their facilities. Aslik being
_Vice_-President is already a big tell, but Dripik even points out
that "[He's] gonna be pissed" and that "if he ever comes back [they're]
screwed", making it undisputable who's the boss after all[^2]. However, it
might be a bigger surprise that Aslik isn't the Vice-President of FeeCo,
instead he is VP of SoulStorm Brewery[^3], also owned by Molluck[^4]. The
Brewmaster is, despite his pompous title, just some lackey, who was
ambitious (and perhaps competent) enough to take over in the boss'
absence.

The messy interior of the destroyed vault.

He also owned a personal vault in RuptureFarms, which - as the pictures
imply - contained some of his most treasured belongings, including a lot of
Moolah. The painting hanging on the background was especially interesting
to me, as it portrays a young Molluck standing sheepishly next to his
always menacing mother, which is not exactly a side of him one can see a
lot. Another thing I noticed was the chair, which is surprisingly similar
to what you could find here on Earth. With Glukkon anatomy being so
different, one can't help but wonder how would they even sit on a chair
like this.

A piece of concept art from the cancelled Oddworld
movie: Molluck observing some of the many hanging Mudokon cells, where the
tired workers return to get as much rest as they possibly can.

Even his name was a clever choice as it is a reference to [Moloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch), the Biblical
false god of child sacrifice. The children here of course being the
offspring of Sam, the Mudokons. Despite this - and some might disagree - I
don't think Molluck is such a clear-cut evil character as the games portray
him.

The slaughter of innocents is an unforgivable choice and I'm not trying
to justify it, however, it's not like there were any better alternatives
either.  Remember, Molluck had to satisfy not only his very demanding mother,
but also the vicious group of Investors. And as Abe tells us, the
"profits were grim".  Quite likely if he hadn't made a choice like this, he
and his colleagues would have ended up on the chopping block, with someone
even crueller, but also more efficient taking over.

I'd like to end this post with the short timeline of what happened to
him after the end of Abe's Oddysee. As we seen in the canon good ending,
the Mudokons conjure a mystical thunderstorm over RuptureFarms and struck
the nearby Slig to death with a well aimed lightning bolt. The same fate
follows Molluck, whose suit disintegrates, revealing the Glukkons'
surprising anatomy. Except...

He doesn't actually die. Either with a huge amount of luck or the
meddling of Oddworldian gods, Molluck is 'merely' knocked unconscious and
branded by the electricity passing through his head. The storm causes the
factory to erupt in flames, however, Molluck gets himself together before
he burns alive and escapes by unknown means. The authorities raid the
factory, but since they can't find his corpse he is declared wanted for
causing a loss of profit to the cartel.

The lore here becomes quite vague. Where, how and when this happens is
not known, but one thing is sure: Molluck, despite his best intentions to
hide from the Cartel, was finally captured and he was brought before his
very angry mother[^5], who has to answer to the investors for his son's
mistakes. After a likely thunderous and devastating scolding by Margaret,
Molluck is escorted to an elevator to meet and to try to explain himself
before the investors. This is where the known lore ends about him, and thus
his fate is left unknown, but knowing who's he up against, I don't think he
has a chance..

Molluck in Soulstorm

What little we know of Soulstorm seems to mostly follow this plotline
with a few modifications[^6]. Molluck here tries to warn the other Glukkons
about the dangers of Abe, but they think Molluck is just in for the
insurance money and he was caught. And because of their prejudice, Abe will
be able to succeed. Also we can see the guild which Molluck belongs to, the
Stockgluks, whose job is to breed and provide creatures for the
industry.
