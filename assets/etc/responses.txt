Exoddus is my favourite the grit and the music just make it one of the best game experiences you can have.

I just Love Strangers Wrath

USA

Oddworld: Soulstorm. ANZ.

I've played many but stranger's wrath was my favorite.üòéü§òüèΩ - Isiah. North America

Region: North America
Favorite: Oddworld: New ‚Äòn‚Äô Tasty

The original Abe‚Äôs Oddysee is truly a masterpiece to behold. Words cannot describe how many hours of joy and fun I‚Äôve had with the original on the PS1. The remake was something where for the first time ever I‚Äôve followed updates on every single detailed work of progress when the game was first announced officially with the pre-alpha footage back in September 2012.

When the game finally came out on July 22, 2014 I was astounded of the work that was put into it. Had no issues of the gameplay and controls, atmosphere was dialed up to 11 though I can understand where people are coming from when they claim things were ‚Äútoo bright, too clean‚Äù etc. Personally, I feel it wasn‚Äôt trying to live in the original‚Äôs shadow, the remake is it‚Äôs completely own thing and I respect that a lot. Personally I prefer the remake to the original but that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt think any less of the it. Lorne Lanning has stated that he didn‚Äôt feel the need to change the story at all, he felt the fable was a concise package for what it was and only wished to bring said fable into the 21st century.

New additions both big and small were included such as how Abe entered each temple when traveling these new lands unknown to him and how now naturally Abe can call multiple mudokons to follow him. Details such as the lifted cages the workers sleep, SoulStorm Brew being in the factory, Alf's Escape bring completely original content for Oddworld after quite sometime.

If there was only one issue but it‚Äôs not truly a issue is when Alf's Escape released, I wished there were cutscenes and still to this day (with all do respect) no one knows what time of period this takes place in. It‚Äôs presumed to be during the events of Abe‚Äôs return to Rupture Farms but respectfully I wish there was more clarity. Like if the mission was somehow incorporated into the main game.

However, that‚Äôs only me being miffed. I‚Äôm not bothered by it at all. The game was all that I wanted for a faithful remake that in my eyes has proven to be the definitive way to experience the Abe‚Äôs Oddysee story. Originally New ‚Äòn‚Äô Tasty wasn‚Äôt intended to be the rebirth of the Oddworld Quintoligy as far as I‚Äôm aware but thanks to Soulstorm we can be on track to finally finish it since it‚Äôs been officially considered part 1 with Soulstorm being part 2!

Thanks for all the memories.

North America.
I would love to win this! I remember playing the original Oddworld back in the 90s. SO much fun!

My favorite Oddworld game is Munch‚Äôs Oddysee! I LOVE all the games but Munch‚Äôs Oddysee stands out to me the most!! It was the game that really got me into the Oddworld games. Why? MANY REASONS! To this day, as a 21+ year old, I STILL FIND MYSELF SAYING THE SILLY PHRASES OF ALL THE CHARACTERS!! I definitely overused the soundboard haha!! Also, if i‚Äôm not mistaken, Munch‚Äôs Oddysee was the first open world game for Oddworld! What a huge advancement. Another thing I love are the fuzzles! ADORABLE AND READY TO BEAT UP BADDIES! The story was really good too and I thank my dad for introducing this game to me as a kid. I always looked forward to playing it after school. One of my favorite games ever and i‚Äôm glad this AND Stranger‚Äôs Wrath gets to be on the Switch ü§†.

REGION: NORTH AMERICA, UNITED STATES

Nothing beats going to my neighbors for pizza on a Wednesday night as a kid and playing Abe's Oddysee (USA)

My favorite Oddworld game is definitely Abe's Exoddus which I played back in 2017/2018 on PC, actually Idk if I played exoddus or Munch's oddysee first.

I'm in North America

I grew up with my dad's OG playstation and a copy of Abes Odyssey :) as soon as the remake of it was announced for ps4 I pre ordered it so fast. I absolutely love it and it's my favorite game in the series.

North America here!

My favourite Oddworld game is extremely difficult to choose. I loved the relationship between Munch and Abe - the banter is something that I often quote in random conversation to this day lol.
But my favourite game has to be Abe's Exoddus. The inclusion of a whole different mechanic with the Muds with different emotions was awesome, and I loved that Abe was putting together an army of Muds to take down Soulstorm instead of just doing it alone. :)

I am from Australia!

My father showed me Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee when I was about 4, scared me, but was fun to play it with him, Stranger's Wrath is my favorite. Texas, NA

Abe's Oddysee for sure. Was actually one of the first games I ever saw played before I was allowed to play them myself. :D

United States!

I was 5 back in 2002 when I got my first xbox with Munch's Oddysee and although I really couldnt play video games, I remember sitting for hours in front of the tv with my sister figuring out all the various maps and making fuzzles out of balls of paper üòÜ I've since enjoyed rediscovering and completing the game and waited feverishly for it on switch!

From England, Europe!

Strangers wrath is my favorite! Running around and doing the bounties for the surprisingly deep narrative was amazing. Next to that might be Munch‚Äôs! Looking forward to Soulstorm! My region is North America!

Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee on the Playstation 1! My cousin brought ir over one day and I was hooked :)

My all time favorite was Abe‚Äôs Exoddus. Oddworld has been by my side since the nineties since I was 7. It‚Äôs basically the reason why I became a vegetarian.
My Region is NorthAmerica.

gotta agree with everyone calling out Stranger as a favorite, it's one of the most creative shooters i've ever played

USA :thumbsup:

(North America) I've played Oddworld games since back in the PS1 days! Remember having to swap over to disk two on my favorite (Abe's Oddysee). Was really excited to see New n' Tasty and have loved your games for years. And hey, if I don't win, I'll drop like whatever it takes to have another Oddworld switch produced. That thing is sick.

Strangers wrath has and always will be my favourite oddworld game even though the only way to play it now is with the remasters otherwise it looks a bit muddy in some areas

Ireland/europe

Strangers Wrath for the win, use to play that all the time. We used to make the game harder by trying to play the whole game only using one \"ammo\", endless fun.

The one I remember playing the most is Oddworld Munch‚Äôs Oddysee on the original Xbox. So much nostalgia. From North America. Collierville, Tennessee.

I played Stranger's Wrath as a kid and loved it ever since! Munch's Oddysee is up there too, but SW has always been my favorite and I've come back to it so many more times than I can count. NA.

It's so hard to pick just one. From the original on Playstation, when I was just a wee lad, to the strange gameboy ports, to the new and updated games, I just feel such an attachment to this weird series. I've been following it's progress for years. I remember how hyped I was when Stranger's Wrath was first announced, and how devastated I was when Fangus was cancelled. When I thought the company was going under and there wouldn't be any more Oddworld games, I legitimately mourned.

But I digress. My favorite game was definitely Stranger's Wrath. The humour, action, world-building, and twist, all blew me away.

(It also doesn't hurt that it was the first one I ever actually beat.)

Got so much fun playing Abbe Oddyse. Oddworld is a great universe one of the best game brand of all time.
North America here !

Abe's exoddus! First of the series I played and the improved mechanics from the first made it better after.
North America.

I played it the Abe's Odyssee on ps1 and I loved going around burping and farting on the characters

Florida

I loved Stranger's Wrath and the remasters. Still the most challenging games I've played.

US/North America

Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee... I can't count how many time did I play this game as a child, and re-played as a man enjoyng it in the same way. Still fascinated by the world and the characters.
From Europe, this is all. Now, back to the studio!

I‚Äôve played every Oddworld game made, including the GameBoy ones. It‚Äôs my favorite series of all time, I even have two tattooed based on OWI! So it‚Äôs hard to pick a favorite. But, Oddworld: Abe‚Äôs Oddysee started it all! So it will always hold a special spot for me! I have a pretty big OWI collection, so this one of a kind Switch would be the crown jewel!!

(North America)

Oddworld Abe‚Äôs Oddysee is still the most memorable to me. That first level in the factory creeped me out so much. I watched my dad play through it on our PC. I was too scared to play it myself, but I really wanted to see Abe get out of Rupture Farms safely! The monsters were all so unique too. Even though they were scary and could kill you, the game was really about respecting these creatures. One of the all time greats!
From: Idaho, USA

I have only ever played Munch's Oddysee, waaaaay back in the day on OG Xbox with that giant controller that was way too big for my little hands lol. I loved everything about that game, from the art to the story, and getting attached to Munch (and later with Abe's help) as he goes along rescuing eggs and Fuzzles from a horrible fate. It's a surreal game series in a horrific dystopian land, which adds to my intrigue. I would love to be able to play the rest of the series on Switch!
Colorado Springs U.S.A.

I played Abe's odessy a lot as a kid, on my dad's pc. Lol just be for he lent me my own. Later I played strangers wrath on the old Xbox and loved it too. I never had the chance to play munchies thogh any way in in north America

I'm from the United States and I was really young when I first played an Oddworld game. I didn't know much about it but a part of me was so fascinated by Munch's Oddysee. I was so drawn in by the cinematic aspects and setting. Watching the characters die or get chased was so heartfelt for little me. I appreciate the experience more than anything. Thank you for pouring your hearts into it. I love this series to this day and I hope to see more and more!

Stranger's Wrath is definitely my favorite Oddworld game and easily in my top 5 games of all time. Everything from the simple yet effective story to the incredible aesthetics to the amazingly visceral FPS gameplay makes it legitimately hard for me to ever put the game down! It all makes me hope that we get another Oddworld game where we get to explore this amazing universe in 3D again, let alone in a direct sequel.

My region is North America (Florida, USA).

Abe's Exodus. Can I have that Switch. I just need a little money to get to Santa Barbara because my cat is sick. I'm a christian.

North America, Fort Wayne

Oddworld: Stranger‚Äôs Wrath is my favourite. It is the first and only one I got to play. Makes me want to play the others too.

Europe here.

My fav is Stranger's Wrath!

[North America]

My favorite game was Munches Oddesy, it was the first Oddworld game I played on Xbox and now I‚Äôm replaying it on the Switch! US-NY

I always loved Exoddus the most, as some of my favorite locations are within this game. Slig Barracks, FeeCo Depot, and Necrum are just incredible places! And the art design is phenomenal!

I am from NZ

Oddworld: Abe‚Äôs Exoddus is by far my
favorite. It was bigger, darker, and Odder! My region is the United States

My favorite is Munch's Odyssey. Was the first game I got for the Original Xbox. Is a game that's near and dear.

US

I played abes oddysee on ps1 with my nan when i was about 4 years old, and to this day its still my favourite game of all time, it single handedly made me love gaming like i do today. I still have a PS2 to this date just to make sure i can play Abes Oddysee and Exoddus whenever i want.

The foreground art in abe was exceptional, and for a game made in 1997 it really was years ahead of its time and i just want to say from a huge fan thankyou for the series its really done a lot for me.

I have recently played IOS versions of New n Tasty and Munch‚Äôs Oddysee and they were spot on as well, i have tried to play Strangers Wrath but it does not work unfortunately, so it would be great to have a chance at winning a switch so i can play it properly!

England/Europe

Abe's Oddysee is da best, I'm in the U.S.

My first game I ever finished was Oddworld Abe's oddysee, I still hold it near and dear to my heart. I still say hello sometimes to my sisters like Abe.

I'd say Oddworld Abe's Exodus, it's honestly impressive how you made such a great and long game that was more expansive than the first game in such a short amount of time. Plus those eyeless Mudokons, *shivers*

My Favorite is the Original Oddworld Abe's Oddysee for starting this amazing franchise and i absolutely love the voice of Abe and his design plus the Cutscenes still look amazing to this day even when compared to New and Tasty!

My favorite Oddworld was Exoddus. I loved everything about it, the packaging, the way the game starts, the new abilities. It was an awesome move forward from the first. I'm in the US by the way.

I'm in North America, and I love them all! If I had to pick a favorite probably Exoddus, which has me so excited for Soulstorm!

Abe‚Äôs Exoddus! Even though not TECHNICALLY part of the Oddworld Quintology, it was bigger and better in every way compared to the first, and I wish it got more love! North America region!

My favorite is probably Stranger's Wrath but I love all of them. Steef4lyfe

my favorite was munchs odyssey. it was one of the first games i had on the original xbox and have such fond memories saving fuzzles! usa here :) good luck everyone!

I'm a big fan of Stranger's Wrath and New N' Tasty

US

Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus. North America

I love them all! If I had to choose though, strangers wrath is my favorite. A first person oddworld blew my mind! North America

Definitely Oddysee. Though I love Exoddus, my heart will always belong to the original which began my lifetime obsession with Oddworld. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Region: North America

Strangers wrath got my attention from the very beginning fun game. USA

Never had an opportunity to try out an Oddworld game, would love to try it now since it's on the switch. Region would be Australia/New Zealand (:

My favourite Oddworld game is Abe's Oddysee.

I was born in 1997, so I wasn't old enough to play the game when it was released (but I came out the same year the game did and we're both beloved classics - coincidence?) but when I was old enough to play games, my Dad gave me his PS1 which included Abe's Oddysee and Exoddus as well as some others.

I played Oddysee first and I loved it. I was terrible at it and it was super difficult for an 8 year old to play, but having my Dad help me and play co-op with me are some of the best memories I have, period. Oddysee ignited my love for these games and I have owned every single Oddworld game since. Even though I'm now almost 23, I still play these games on the same PS1, but also mobile and Steam.

Thanks to Steam's new co-op feature, I can still play co-op Oddworld with my Dad, even though we no longer live in the same country. It keeps me connected with my Dad, just like we were when we'd sit on the same couch when I was a little kid.

Thanks for the memories, nostalgia and relationships, Oddworld!

My region is USA!

Favorite is Munch's Oddysee -- probably because it's the first one I played.

USA

Hi, Oddworld fan since Day One here in the United States.

Abe's Oddysee will always hold a special place in my heart, since it was my first introduction to Oddworld and it was instrumental in teaching me about the real-world we live in.

My favorite Oddworld game is Abe's Exoddus. And I want to play Soulstorm as soon as it will be released !
Europe for me.

oddworld abe odysse is my fav offworld game
North america here

I loved playing the original Abe's Odyssey on PS1. It was one of the first games I actually replayed over and over to get all the ending. I had to get New & Tasty when it came out because I loved the original games so much!

California here!

Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee I played it when it released I was 7 years old at the time and I had a blast. I won't forget how hilarious it was that there was a key that would allow me to fart in a video game it gave me the most chuckles it could. As I got older I enjoyed the story-line of the game.

USA

Never played the game, looks interesting

From NA

I've gotta say, my favorite game was always Abe's Exoddus. I always loved how much bigger it felt and more streamlined it felt than the first game, and I've been playing oddworld since I was a little kid. I love all the games, but Exoddus will always be my favorite.
I live in Oregon in the united states, where the forests near my house always reminded me of Paramonia.

It was Abes Exodus for me. I loved the addition features and the continuation of Abes journey.

Always enjoyed the melancholy of these games and this one was packed.

Uk/Europe.

I‚Äôve played strangers wrath the best way possible my entire life, on the original Xbox. Hours and multiple saved files have been made, at least about 1,000? The wolvark run is absolutely painful! Especially when you save it JUST before you die! This art piece will make me and my little brother overjoyed with excitement! If we don‚Äôt get this beauty our fan art will definitely create something from this inspiration. Pennsylvania/USA

Abe's Oddysee is one of my most cherished gaming memories when it comes to the PS1. I rented and rented it over and over again until i finally saved all the mudokens and then eventually bought the game for myself when the videostore closed.

United States/Texas here

My Favourite has always been Abe's Exodus. It really did just improve on every aspect n though tedious I respected that emotions were considered. Like I feel it wouldn't be as appreciated in this day n age but you really felt for them when u accidentally get their mate killed n they throw themselves into the nearest path to join them unless you talk to them. N finally getting to shoot down screen as Sligs. I genuinely played that game all my way through growing up.

Scotland, Europe

My favorite game of the series is Oddworld: Abe's Exodus but I never have the chance to play both Munch's Odyssey and Stranger's Wrath...
Europe here!

My favorite oddworld game is probably Munch's Oddyssey. I remember the best Christmas I ever had was getting the original Xbox and that game as a kid. My birthday is July 18, so here's hoping I win!
North America, USA.

Munch's Odyssey holds a special place in my heart.

Belgium - Europe üôÇ

Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee, hands down. It's definitely the gem of Oddworld that catapulted me to love the the series as a whole. I've played it when I was 7 years old (which was the game's release as well) so the struggle is real but fun.

Not sure if Asia is included but yea, Asia!

Strangers Wrath is my favorite game of all time! It has such an amazing world, characters, art, gameplay, ect. I first played it on the original Xbox, then I beat the HD version of the game on steam. The Oddworld series as a whole has inspired me through art and general creativity, it‚Äôs a game that If didn‚Äôt exist I wouldn‚Äôt know about this series, so I thank the entire Oddworld team for this world that they‚Äôve created.

America/Pennsylvania

I've played a few, but my favourite has to be the original Abe's Oddysee! I had the demo version for years before I was able to play the full game, so it was really exciting to suddenly have the whole game map available to play! Also, fun fact, I thought that 'oddysee' was the correct spelling of 'odyssey' well into adulthood because of this game, haha.

I'm in the UK :)

My mom rented 2 things for me back in the day at BlockBuster: Bowling for Columbine by Michael Moore, and Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee. Both had a big impact on me, and I later got Stranger's Wrath on release for my original Xbox, and even managed to find a PSX copy of Abe's Exoddus at a local shop before prices got too high. Stranger's Wrath is one of my favourite games of all time, let alone favourite Oddworld game, its unique combination of exploration and shooting is still a lot of fun to this day, and the charm and big heart that these games have is what makes them stand out as great works of art.

North America (Canada)

I loved munches oddesy for the open 3d world and from them I have supported the community and series since

Europe here

Strangers Wrath for sure. This Switch looks amazing! United States here.

I love Abe's Oddysee, because it's an original adventure chronicling my first outing - saving my fellow Mudokons. My name is Abe and I'm Odd You See. üòÅ

England / Europe

My favorite has to be the original, when it came out there really wasnt anything like it. As a kid it was definitely on the strange side for me but I grew to love it after I grew a little older...such fond memories.

USA

I have played Abe's Exoddus a bunch of times despite having never played Abe's Oddysee. As an American fan of Oddworld I can tell you I'm pretty hyped for the Switch ports of Stranger's and Munch's, but Soulstorm... GivePLS.

Hello! I‚Äôm in the US/ Michigan. I‚Äôd have to say my favorite Oddworld is Munch‚Äôs Oddyssee, my uncle owned it for the original Xbox & I remember loving it & playing it so much as a kid. I hope you add new & tasty to switch soon! & eventually hope the new one comes to switch as well. I don‚Äôt split collections between consoles & I already begin this one for the switch, so I‚Äôll only buy them from there!

My all time Faavorite Oddworld was Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee
I remember the great times I would have with my brother doing the emotes \"I dont know\" & especially the fart one xD some great times with Oddworld I'm sure we've All had would be awsome to win one of these I would secretly surprise my older brother and Gift it to him, Best of great luck to Everyone & Blessings <3 : ) also I'm from (North America)

I'd probably have to go with Oddworld Munch's Oddysee being the first 3D entry in the series it took a bold step forward.

Played Oddysee and Exoddus on the PlayStation back in the 90s and really enjoyed the atmosphere of the games. Europe (UK).

I love all the games! But i think my favourite has to be Abes Exoddus. I used to play it with sister taking turns to solve puzzles. I have so many happy memories of counting beeps and flashes on bombs and timing jumps just right! It is the bench mark i use to measure all other platform games. We live in the UK. Oh and the 18th of July is my birthday üéÇ just saying x

Oddworld: Abes Exoddus is an amazing game and not only my favorite in the Oddworld series, but my favorite game of all time!

Stranger's Wrath, it has that classic Oddworld atmosphere which I love, mixed in with some Spaghetti Western which I also love. UK, Coventry

My favourite game is Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee a lot of it is likely due to nostolgia, it was the first game I played in the series since my dad got me into it, whenever I got stuck I would go find him for help and he'd walk me through... I spent years quoting Abes \"follow me\" voice as I was obsessed. I know my dad would also still be heavily into these games if he were alive, they're incredible, funny and forever progressing. They can be extremely frustrating but very rewarding. This game will always hold a very special place in my heart.
From United Kingdom

I'm a huge fan of Munch's Oddysee, the way you've pulled out that 3d environment was brilliant and everything just pops, and also the ambient music! Hopefully I get a change to win something
South Carolina

I found a copy of Abes Exodus at a yard sale when I was in highschool and since then I've played all the games but I will always be my favorite. USA here.

I have no Switch and never played Oddworld. This is a chance to fix both! I'm in the United States / North America, btw.

I remember being introduced to Abe‚Äôs Exodus when I was in primary school and immediately buying it from Blockbusters. My friend and I were crazy about it and used to role play the game on the playground at school and imitate everything from the possessions, to sligs and glukkons having insane business meetings. We must have looked quite crazy to everyone else! It has always been my favourite Oddworld game ever since and I revisit it from time to time :)

I am from Europe (UK).

Favorite Oddworld is Stranger's Wrath

mostly due to the bounty hunter vibe

Oddworld Strangers Wrath on the original Xbox. Was fun playing growing up. It was very crazy and imaginative. Man, this takes me back haha. Still need to play New N Tasty though. NA

Honestly the original Abe‚Äôs Exoddus still hold a special place in my heart since it was my intro to the Oddworld. I was even blessed to met Lorne Lanning a number of years ago at GDC back when it started in San Jose CA. Super sweet guy!

Stranger's Wrath was hype

My favorite OddWorld game is Munch's Oddysee, it was my childhood game and I've replayed it many times, I still think about how the poor fuzzles looked at the bad ending credit scene. I'm in North America

I really like Abe odyssey, new n tasty, I worked for McDonalds, so I really related to abe. USA, California.

I've only ever played new n tasty but I somehow ended up having it downloaded on 4 different systems so it counts for something

Oddworld stranger's wrath

Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus had me hooked. It had wonderful graphics for its time and great game play.

USA here.

I first played the Abe's Oddysee demo for the playstation on some random demo disk, where it set mines in just a certain way that you couldn't go into the stockyards and had to blow yourself up. I was utterly captivated by the creature designs and the dull creepy colours of rupture farms and have followed Oddworld inhabitants ever since.
(America)

My all time favorite Oddworld game is Stranger's Wraith. I don't finish many games 1 time through, let alone multiple times,but Stranger's Wraith I have played through several times.

Maine, US here üòÅ

I‚Äôd have to say Oddworld Strangers Wrath is my favorite because the great visuals! I think the story line and art is great! Was one of the only games I played on the Xbox as a youngin‚Äô
North America/WV

I live in usa, my fav is munches odyssey! Its the 1st game i played and ive beat it 100 times. 2nd fav is strangers wrath! Love the outlaw style. I got my dad hooked too. We cant wait for strangers wrath 2!

i've played the oddworld stranger wrath at a friends house and i'm only participating because i want to gift my boyfriend a switch :) i'm from south america/ brazil!

hello! i've only played oddworld at a friend's house, so thats pretty much my \"favorite\" lol
brazil / south america here!

oddworld stranger's* wrath sorry :)

Oddworld Strangers's Wrath. I liked the Wild West setting. It has always been very intriguing to me because of the cowboy movies like Young Guns I grew up with. I a from North America, The United States.

Oddworld Abe's Odyssey, cuz it felt do different growing up. NA region. Thank you!

I would have to say Stranger's Wrath is by far my favorite game of all time! I have bought it on my original XBOX, PS Vita, Nvidia Shield Portable, and now on my Nintendo Switch! On my Switch I bought both digital and hard copy because I love this game so much! I would absolutely love this custom system and would pay ALOT of MOOLAH for it!!!

Stranger‚Äôs Wrath first time playing oddworld and become a fan straight away. Australia

Odd World Abe‚Äôs Odysee. It was one of my dads games and he would sit down with my sister and I and show us what to do. We did spend a lot of time in the sound board having a laugh over the farts. Good times.
Ohio, United

I have played every Oddworld game, which says a lot because I don‚Äôt play video games. I have every game so far on one platform or another. My favorite is Abe‚Äôs Exoddus. I have it for the PC. I also have it for the original playstation. But I prefer it on the PC. I don‚Äôt know why Abe has caught my attention the way he has, but I can honestly say I have never played another game the way I play Oddworld. I live in North America. And I am a huge fan. I almost bought a ps5 when I heard it was coming to the ps5 first. I can not wait to play the new one.

It's hard to pick, but I'll go with Stranger's Wrath.
Europe

The Switch has basically become my main gaming device at this point, so having Oddworld: Stranger‚Äôs Wrath on it is just the best of both worlds, and not a little bit odd! üòÇ

Oddworld Abe's Exodus has been my favorite title, it played on the success of Odyssey which is kind of a necessary inclusion as it sets up the events of Exodus. Though the mini video you can watch that explains what happened was pretty great too lol

USA, Davenport, Iowa

Strangers Wrath HD, NA/US region

I would love to know more about Stranger's species, and how they allied with the Grubs. And I also NEED to know what happened to Sekto after the ending.

Canada is where, me, myself, live up above the Americans :)

Oh boy my favourite has to be New 'n Tasty!

I'm from Europe/The Netherlands

Europe, Netherlands.

Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee on ps1!
One of my first titles on the system.

Ps. I dont mind paying the postal/Import (or any other additional) costs for that switch system.
Looks very cool and I'd love to have it.

Favorite is Stranger's Wrath, always like the western theme coupled with fantasy and the flow of gameplay switching between 1st and 3rd person felt fun and well done. North America, SoCal.

I still have new n tasty but I love strangers wrath, I spent a lot of hours on it on the Xbox, I‚Äôm looking to play the new one ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè
North America.
United States.

Some of my oldest memories are from watching my siblings play Abe's Oddysee on the PlayStation 1. My dad bought us Abe's Exoddus the following year and I was hooked. I played through those two games every single year, doing better and better until I finally rescued all possible mudokons in both games, I'll never forget those times.

Thank you for the chance! I love the story in Abe's Oddysee. Elum is literally my favorite. North America.

My favorite would have to be New n' Tasty - it keeps the simple and effective formula that defined the original while making the difficulty a bit less crushing.
USA

Oddworld: Abe's Odyssey. I played the game multiple times when I was young, trying to save all Mudokons. Unfortunately I never succeeded! Maybe it‚Äôs time to give it another try :).
I live in North America, US

My favourite Oddworld game would have to be Abe's Exodus. Such a good story with a great protagonist! The world that was created still is one of my faves from a video game. Really hope Oddworld bring out some new games!

Funnily enough, I've always been partial to Stranger's Wrath. It's an odd mix of first person shooters with 3D platforming; my bread and butter! Played it back in the Xbox days, had it on iOS, looking forward to taking it to the Switch.
North America!

I grew up with Oddworld: Munch's Odyssey when I got it on the original Xbox. It got me into the Oddworld franchise, and I've been hooked ever since, getting the original Playstation's Oddworld: Abe's Odyssey, and Oddworld: Abe's Exodus, as well as having Stranger's Wrath on my Ps Vita! I'm so looking forward to the new Oddworld: Soulstorm coming out on the next gen consoles, as well as the Stranger's Wrath HD remaster!

I fell in love with the first Oddworld game Abes Oddysee but was completely blown away by Abes Exodus. I got it for Xmas as a kid and played it solidly all Xmas and boxing day. Outstanding games.

I love Strangers Wrath, one of my favorites from that generation of games.

I'm in the US!

Oddworld has always played a huge part in my gaming life, but my favourite is still Abe's Oddysee. The challenges of saving every Mudoken, seeing part of the world for the first time, those amazing cut scenes, Elum (need I say more?), and of course the humour!
Location: Sydney, Australia

It has to be the Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee! Right after school tried to
play it when my parents where assleep, because they thought I was too
young to play. From the Netherlands! :D

Favorite game has to be Abes Exodus. It was one of mtmy first games on the ps1 and it definitely shaped my viewpoint on what is good in a game.

North America.

Abe's Exodus - loved controlling the paramites, flying sligs and scrags. Great full colour manual for the PC version aswell. Europe/UK

Strangers Wrath is one of my all time favs. The game is so much fun, and I love the creature designs. North America

Played Stranger's Wrath back on the original XBOX. Remains a staple of my youth to this day! :)

USA

Growing up with Oddworld Abe's Oddysee on PC would have to be one of my fondest memories. Firing up our Pentium 1 PC. Controlling slugs, making Abe fart. I could never finish the game as I kid, but definitely a game apart of my childhood.
Australia, Melbourne

Stranger's Wrath has been my favorite game since its release. I spent hours playing it with my kids, who are now grown, and to this day, we use the \"mole's ass\" password at the front door.

My all time favorite Oddworld game has to be strangers wrath I remember growing up playing it and feeling so immersed in the world! Definitely one of my all time favorite games! Such a great switch design, if you are in contact with the team please thank them for all the amazing games!!

Abe‚Äôs Oddysee was THE video game that got me into gaming. It‚Äôll always have a special place in my heart. Still have the art book on my book shelf right now. North America

Oddworld Exoddus will forever remain a favorite of mine! It got me through a lot of hardships in the past and I always enjoyed the challenging pace of it and of course, possessing explosive farts üòÇ

Gotta go with Abes oddesy from '97. I remember back when new games came out that were new ideas and exciting, not just copies or for example the souls-like stuff. I miss that feeling. It seems rare these days. You guys always keep it fresh and that feeling alive. Good luck to everyone entering! North America, Michigan.

Oddworld. Where to begin? I've been a fan of Oddworld for as long as I can remember. When i was three I received my very first game console for Christmas of 2003. The original Xbox. With it I received a copy of Oddworld: Munches Oddysee. It was my favorite game for some time until my xbox stopped working. Tray issues. So I went what seemed like an eternity until I was handed down a PS2 and a small collection of used PS1 and 2 games. I was flipping through the booty and then WHAM! All of the sudden I spot the name Oddworld. But it wasn't the Oddworld I knew. It was the grandpappy daddy'O itself. Abe's Oddysee, right there in front of me. Filled with excitement and elation, I put it in the tray and lost my mind. Different yet satisfying. \"Where is Munch?\" I probably wondered. The next couple of years were oh so joyous. One day I returned to my fathers house for the weekend and the ps2 was gone. Dad sold it for rent. Too bad so sad. Soon after that I came across an original xbox at a local thrift store. It took a lot of dishwashing but mom finally bought it for me. She even took me to gamestop to get a game. Walking through the seemingly endless archive of games I spot a familiar yet new and tasty name. Flipping Oddworld: Stranger wrath! As if my eyes were drawn to it by some sort of eclectic higher power. \"Was it older or newer\" I wondered. Nevertheless that was the one. I got it, went home and popped it in. Magic. Pure magic. The intro theme rang shivers down my spine. Dark and mysterious. Strange even. Stranger and \"odder\" than its predecessors. With so many new faces and familiar fuzzles (who could forget the fuzzles?) I wasn't even saddened by the fact that Abe or Munch weren't anywhere to be found. So Immediately I was in love. Being 8-ish/9 years old I had felt like a misfit as most people do at this weird age. Oddworld made it seem like an adventure. That is where my obsession with Oddworld had finally matured. For the next decade or so I would come home from school and jump right into the world that made it seem so favorable. I salute Lorne and the teams that put it all together. Hes a mastermind in my opinion. Love you. Thanks a million. Keep odding it up!
United States

Abes odyssey will always be my favourite. Not just my favourite in the series but my overall 1 of my top games. This game will always be special to me. It was the 1st video game my Dad brought just for me, that I didn‚Äôt have to share with my brother. It was just for me, we sat and played level, level, life, life. Best memory I have of my Dad. United Kingdom

My favorite is Oddworld: Abe's Oddyssee., Loved playing it with my husband :) . North America !

i love Munch's Oddysee as i enjoy the different play styles hoping to see a diverse set of characters with stories of their own in soulstorm
Wales / UK / Europe

It's gotta be Stranger's Wrath. It's the wonderful combo of quirky and exciting, and super fulfilling to launch Fuzzles at an enemy and watch them be torn apart.

Stranger's wrath would have to be my favorite one in the series. I'm from North America.

Man, what to pick? I like all Oddworld games I've played, and even finished Stranger's Wrath and loved it! But if I were to pick... Abe's Oddysee! I played it on the PSOne I owned when I was young, and... it was a fantastic first impression for the series! It felt terrifying trying to escape Rupture Farms, mystifying when exploring Scrabania, Paramonia and Monsaic Lines, and the Temples felt ominous... Well, kinda because there are cranky Scrabs and Paramites that want to be the first to try Mudokon Pops if you're not careful. And really... it's a good thing!

I played Abe's Odyssey way back in the day on PS1, some fond memories!

I loved Abe's Oddysee as a kid but was never able to finish it. Finally got round to replaying (and finishing) it some 15 years later and still a classic! Europe.

When I was a kid I was over at my best friends house and we were going to play Resident Evil 2 but he had just gotten Abe's Exoddus so we played that instead, as soon as I went home I got money that I was saving up to purchase the game for myself still my favorite. I am looking forward to seeing what Soulstorm has to offer.

North America

Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus can feel a bit long, but can be extremely rewarding when you save, like, 10 mudokons in one go.

North America, USA

I remember my first Oddworld game was Abe's Oddysee and i was soo little i didn't understand the whole game, but i have strong memories about it still to this day.
My region is Europe, Hungary

Ive played every oddworld game there is! I am a huge fan and it was one of the first games I ever remember playing with my older brothers. My favorite, which I grew up playing, is Abe‚Äôs Oddysee and I still play it every now and again just for the memories. A close second would have to be Strangers Wrath, I really enjoyed that one. My switch broke not long after I got it and I havent been able to get another due to the price increase so this would be amazing for MANY reasons. North America.

Oddworld Munch's Oddysee is my favorite. The graphics were top notch and the world building is insane!

Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee has a nice place in my heart. -North America-

Abe's Exoddus on PS1 is my absolute favorite video game ever! I spent my summers playing this almost whole day when I was a child.

Poland/Europe

I've played all of them to date but my favorite was Munch's Oddysee. Absolutely love the Oddworld universe and gotta say I was so excited seeing the new Oddworld trailer at the PS5 reveal. When Abe started to cut his mouth stitches out that brought a massive smile to my face being a fan for so long and seeing him free himself. Also I love in North America, North Carolina.

My favorite is Abe's Exodus. Back to the factory!!!! Abe will save us all.

Region: North America

It‚Äôs hard because I have so much attachment to Abe‚Äôs Oddysee. I played it when it came out with my dad. That weekend visit has a very special place in my heart, but as for my favorite? Abe‚Äôs Exodus! I had so much fun beating it as a kid and it stuck with me. Particularly that final moment in the good ending where Abe is showing the other mudokens the moon. I love the themes of heritage and importance in these games and that‚Äôs a really good example of it.

North America - USA.

It's difficult to pinpoint which title is my favorite, but I'll say Munch's Oddysee! Let me take you back to the early 2000's. I'm a child enjoying some Munch on my Xbox. Being a kid (who probably didn't read or fully comprehend the game) I didn't understand that you SAVE the characters! So I'm playing along, the story is getting more intense, characters are reaching their resolves, etc. I'm feeling the momentum. All the sudden we're met by a gang of oddly behaved fuzzles.......and well I think you know the rest! (ahem bad ending ahem) I ran downstairs to my mom crying seeking consolement, meanwhile she's thinking \"what in the world..?\"
Every now & then, to this day she mentions it \"hey remember that game that had you running around the house in tears? What was that?\" Then I proceed to school the family on Oddworld. :) - side note, I did learn the error of my ways! I went & beat the game properly & tracked down the PS1 games. The rest was history :)
THANK YOU for the memories!!!

Huge fan of the entire series, been playing since I was a kid, and it'd be heckin cool to in cause I never win anything. Favorite game is easily Abe's Oddysee and/or New n' Tasty, you just can't beat the classics, though I expect Soulstorm might just prove me wrong ;) oh also North America~

Munch's Oddysee for SURE. Still to this day one of my all time favorite games. So glad to have you guys back:) - Justin (North America)

Having recently purchased Stranger's Wrath for the Switch I can honestly say I regret not picking it up much sooner. The HD version of the game is fantastic and runs beautifully docked and handheld. That being said, I think nothing tops New 'n' Tasty! Remade to perfection by Oddworld & Just Add Water.

Stranger's Wrath is definitely my favorite! USA! North America!

My FAVORITE game would have to be Munch's Oddysee, mainly because I grew up watching my dad play games such as big n tasty in complete awe; and it wasn't until Munch's Oddysee came out that I was finally old enough to dive into the Oddworld universe. Its always been extremely nostalgic for me and I've been having a blast playing it on my switch with my little cousin. Ever since then gaming has not been the same and I am completely stoked to see that you guys are back! Whether I win or not, im sure any Oddworld fan can agree, having you guys back makes us all winners. Thank you for supplying nostalgia for the last century and may you continue doing so. Love and Light.
Justin (Chicago, IL North America)

My favorite odd world has always been Abe‚Äôs Odyssey, on ps1. I have so many childhood memories of that game. I and my sibling used to walk around and imitate the noise Abe makes when he chanted... I believe at one point we were too young to really know the name of the game so we would say ‚Äùyou wanna play illyeell (the chanting)

Strangers Wrath but Abe's Odyssey was what got me into Oddworld.

Oddworld New 'N Tastythe first and best for me. What a memories!

Abe's Exoddus is and will forever be my favorite childhood game! Blame the amazingly designed world for that :P
Greetings from Europe and best of luck to everyone!

I absolutely loved Munchs Oddyssey. I remember playing it on Xbox and just getting immersed in the lore and the characters. Although I absolutely loved Strangers Wrath and reading the manual with info about the different ammo types.

Odd world New N‚Äô Tasty was always my favorite. Brings back soo many memories. NY USA

My personal favorite oddworld game is Munch's Oddysee, one of the first games i ever owned as well as the first i ever beat 100% :)

Oddworld was the main reason I got a PlayStation And original Xbox growing up. Still remember playing munch‚Äôs oddysee on Xbox launch day. Can‚Äôt wait for soulstorm! :) North America

As a child, I used to watch my dad play Abes Odysee for the ps1 constantly. Even going as far as to create a nickname for the little guy, \"moogie\" which became a constant point of comedy in my house throughout my childhood.

Wellington New Zealand

I thought this was one of the best games I've ever done and I've been playing since the very beginning I wish there would be a sequel but I don't see much hope of it I'm assuming the comments are how I enter because I didn't see any other information and I'm in the USA

My favourite Oddworld game is Abe's Exoddus. Europe :)

Abe's Exoddus ! Every part of its sounds and visuals are seated into my mind. What a great world to explore.

I'm in USA !

I love the original ps1 oddworld games but my favorite has to be Abe‚Äôs Exoddus! North America!

I loved oddworld: Abes exoddus. I beat the first one when I was really young. This second one is something great!
USA here

I grew up playing Abes exodus and it holds as one of my favorite games! Its a great game that holds its title. I remember seeing the cinematics and awing in their glory at the time, really breath taking! In the USA/North America.

Exoddus. It had the game play of Oddysee, but was more fleshed out and had better game play mechanics. Plus I preferred the setting and the longer game.

For me that would be Abe's Exoddus. The difficulty was more balanced and it had more extensive gameplay possibilities.

Abe's Oddysee is my favorite! I have a lot of good memories of playing with my dad when I was a kid. Endless fart jokes. (North America!)

My favorite Oddworld game was Abe's Oddysee.

Oddworld Stranger's Wrath is one of the best-hidden gems from the original Xbox. It's the only one I have played but it's still my favorite.
North America

The Oddworld games are all amazing, and my favourite games of all time.
I have been playing and collecting Oddworld games and merchandise for many years, and will continue to do so.
I would say that Abe‚Äôs Oddysee and Exoddus are my favourite tho.
Abe is by far my favourite Oddworld hero.

Gainesville, Florida

Hi! I'm from North America and would love the chance to win these. I have to say my favorite so far is Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath since this is the first Oddworld game I had encountered. I saw a friend play through it in its entirety and have been interested in the series ever since! Good luck to everyone!

My favorite Oddworld game would have to be Munch's Oddysey that I played on the original Xbox back in the day, I loved Abe's Odysee and Exodus from my childhood but seeing the series evolve into 3D space was quite something and it stuck with me. Can't wait for Soulstorm.
From Sydney, Australia.

Oddworld stranger's wrath was the best part of my rather small original Xbox collection, I can't wait to play new and tasty, and soulstorm!

My favourite is deffo strangers wrath no question about it uk

Abe exodus has a special hold on my heart, I still have it for my ps1 and it‚Äôs replay value is endless. As a kid nothing brought me more joy than the oddworld games and I plan on showing my kids so we can play through beginning to the end. I encourage anyone who has yet to experience Abe‚Äôs life to join in and enjoy the ride.
-North America, San Antonio,Texas-

Munch‚Äôs odyssey is hand down my favorite but Abe‚Äôs odyssey and Strangers Wrath hold special places in my heart as those are the ones I started with. Richmond Virginia

I loved Abe's Odyssey and Exodus. I started playing when they came out in the '90s. Strangers Wrath was a game changer for me, I fell in love with Oddworld at that point and waited eagerly for the next game to come out. I love everything Oddworld. I live in Virginia USA

Oddworld is my favorite series, and Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus is my favorite video game of all time. How they were able to push out that masterpiece in such a short time frame will always blow my mind. Super unique world-building, storytelling, and social commentary. The soundtrack was killer, and like all Oddworld games, the art is life-changingly good.

My region is North America, and thank you for the chance to win this system. Stranger's Wrath is an incredible game, and that Switch is genuinely hilarious. It makes sense lore-wise too. The Vykkers would totally make a Fuzzle into a video game system as a joke.

QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU -

What do you get when you mix an intense and daring story, dumbfounding cinematics, lovable characters, a vastly extensive universe, and prophetic philosophies? You get an Oddworld game. Out of the five current titles produced by Oddworld Inhabitats, one game stands in particular above all of the rest.

Strongly influenced by nostalgia but also by the most beautiful imagery, story, cinematics, themes, plot, and philosophies I had ever heard of and seen at the time - Oddworld Abe's Oddysee shook me in my seat. That was the game that truly opened my mind up for good.

From Northern America with love!

Sincerely,
Dmitry

I remember watching my cousin play Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee from the safety of behind the couch because I was so scared of the Sligs! Years later with New 'N' Tasty I was able to go back and finally help save Abe and more of his Mudokon friends.

So it's gotta be New 'N' Tasty for me with special mention for the original for scaring me so much that I knew I had to go back one day to finish it!

Jarred from Australia!

Totally identify with you dude. I was so scared playing AO as a child.

My favourite Oddworld game is Abe's Exodus, I can't remember how many times I finished it ! I loved the improvements made on the speaking system and the different moods of the Mudokons. Greetings from France.

I remember trying to play Abe's Oddysee when I was young. I couldn't ever get past the first few screens, but wouldn't stop. It was the difference I was looking for. Then when I was about to get out of gaming, Stranger's Wrath came around. It destroyed what had become the regular drag, and did it well. After that I bought it on everything it's come out for. It's on my phone right now. It's good is why.

USA! NORTH AMERICA! DANG IT!

Easily Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee. Spent so many wonderful hours on my PS1 with this game! It is genuinely the reason why I finally bought my PS4 for so I could play New ‚Äòn‚Äô Tasty. I am now looking for an excuse to buy the Switch ü§≠ UK - Europe

One of the first video games I‚Äôve ever played was Oddworld: Munich‚Äôs Oddysee! I fell in love with it. Still have the original Xbox game!

Kansas, USA

You're gonna make me choose? Doesn't seem right, somehow....
Well, Abe's Oddysee is the one I played most -- my uncle introduced me to it on the PC as a kid, and it quickly became my favorite game, then, eclipsing even the likes of Crash Bandicoot.
It may seem an odd thing to say (ho-ho), but I think the darker elements of the game, especially in its sense of humor, helped me to sorta reconcile a lot of the contradictions I was starting to notice in the world around me at the time -- and, despite the game being quite challenging, I became endlessly fascinated with discovering each new area screen... and then the one after, and so on, because I wanted to see more of the world.
All that said, Stranger might just be... be... Ah! I can't say it.
Anyway, North America, here, but the Switch codes would be wasted on me, as I don't actually own one yet (more than happy for that to change, though [wink-wink, nudge-nudge])....

Stranger‚Äôs Wrath is my favorite as far as gameplay but the original Abe‚Äôs Oddysee was my first favorite game and still holds the most special place in my collection. Especially since the original had a different voice for Abe which I just loved.
Sending this from Albuquerque, NM, in the United States!

I wasn't smart enough as a kid to actually finish Abe's Oddysee, so I just messed around with gamespeak and \"talked\" to Abe

My favorite game is the original Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee. It was the first game I played and introduced me to the wonderful series of Oddworld.

North America (USA)

Abe's oddysee is my favorite of all the oddworld games, I remeber being excited when exoddus came out, and then being bummed about munch's only being relseased on Xbox. I'm excited to being showing my kids the Oddworld universe.

I've always loved Munch's Odyssey, my sister and I played it to death when we were younger and I still play it once a year for it's extremely fun and inventive 3D platforming!
Region: United States/North America

Strangers Wrath is my favorite. So fun to spend hours on! crossbow action was awesome!

North America

The first game I ever played on PS1 was an Abes Odyssey demo with just the first level and I was absolutely hooked. I begged my parents to get me the game and estimate I completed it maybe 1000 times. I love the creativity, imagination and the beautiful design of all the worlds, I was hooked since age 9 and am still hooked 22 years later. I remember seeing Abes Exodus advertised on TV and I lost my mind with excitement. I‚Äôve completed all the Oddworld games and am definitely a self confessed super fan.

UK/ Europe here :)

Can't beat the original! Hours of amazing adventure spent playing it! Can't wait for the new one! Inverness Scotland

I'm the US. My girl and I have played through almost every odd world game! It is her favorite series! This would be amazing to win considering how deep of a bond we have with the games!

Hi Oddworld! I have been following Abe since his first adventure in Abe‚Äôs Oddysee. Me, my brother and even my mother would take turns for hours on end on that good ol PS1. I‚Äôve been a fan since the late 90‚Äôs and have purchased and supported every released title. Strangers Wrath I have a special place for always, the SMILE on my face when you announced its release on Switch. I even have the entire soundtrack on my phone. Every punch, thud slug, sting bee, zap fly and ‚ÄúOooooowaaah‚Äù when stranger jumps. I‚Äôd be honored to have this switch, I‚Äôd cherish it forever. Just as I have cherished every game and console I have ever owned... still intact to this day! Oddworld has always stood out to me from most other video game series because it touches base w a lot of REAL world tragedies such as capitalism, slavery and extinction. Not only, but Oddworld Inhabitants has always done a great job creating a unique universe for us players to explore. I remember those 2D graphics and Lanning‚Äôs long hippie hair! I‚Äôve watched your Studio tours on YouTube! Haha. Hope you pick me, I truly am a devoted fan. I‚Äôm really looking forward to the release of Soulstorm. Damn that brewery.... hopefully I get to play it on my new limited edition Nintendo Switch/ imagine playing Oddworld on an Oddworld edition switch. Wow. Anyways thank you for the years of entertainment and joy!

Abe's Exodus. After that i fell in love with the Oddworld universe üòçüòç. Europe

Abe's Exoddus was my favorite! Took everything I like about the original and expanded on it big time! Bigger levels, more mudokons, dealing with mudokon emotional problems, more creatures to mind control and a bigger story.

USA, Florida

Abe's Oddysee and Exoddus were some of the most fun yet difficult games when they came out, especially if you wanted to save all of the Mudokons. It's hard to pick one since their stories were so integral to the world-building that Oddworld Inhabitants was aiming for, so I would pick both as my favorites. NA region.

My favorite Oddworld game was Munch's Oddysee. It was so much fun. I loved Munch and the Fuzzles so much!

Region is USA, Dallas, TX

My favorite oddworld game is Oddworld Abes Oddysey, it was the first game I ever played on the playstation one. I was 7. My region is US

I think my favorite is Munch's oddysee. I put so many hours into that game looking for every little detail. Beat it a bunch of times as a kid. It's a gem.

United States

Best experience so far? Only played Abes Oddessey on the ps1. And New n Tasty.
Europe..

I cant wait for Soulstorm because my favorite game in the series by far since childhood was Exodus. That, on top of the fact that I'd finally be able to own a very unique switch and play games with my other friends makes me excited.

USA here

Oddworld Abes Oddysee for PS1 blew me away and is my no.1 next to Exodus. Years ago I made a Top 5 list of PS1 platformers
s and OF COURSE Oddworld was No. 1. Shout out from the U.S. Chicago IL.

I am a huge fan of strangers wrath but something about the first game really clicks with me. First played it as a hand me down on ps1. It was unforgettable.

The Original Oddworld is my favorite of course, with exodus as a very close second. I do love them all though!

Stranger's Wrath is my favorite game from Oddworld because of my memories attached to playing it for the first time. It was the during a huge snowstorm and my young son was watching as I played. We stayed up all night just to find out how the amazing story played out.

Forever fan from North America.

Gotta go with the original. Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee. North America

I absolutely loved abes oddysee and then seeing it remade was really exciting so thats my favorite . New york,USA

I was a big fan of the first Abe Oddysee on PSX, it was a magic times... But now the rebuilded one is even much better! So my favorite one is New 'N Tasty! Love all the Oddworld Inhabitants stuffs, as an artist you inspire me a lot guys! Thanks!

I absolutely loved the original but i have to say that my favorite is 'abes exodus' closely followed by strangers wrath. I had all of them preordered right down to new and tasty!

Strangers wrath is my all time favourite game bar none!
My step dad was touring afghanistan when it was released, I was 12 years old and he somehow found it out there and sent it for me and my brother as a surprise for our xbox, my brother wasn't fussed.. I was infatuated!! And I honestly have been ever since, I'm a huge gamer but I always come back to this one when I need a feel good game!

Oddworld Abe's Oddysee. It's the one that started it all for me. I was 9 years old when it came out and it quickly became my favorite PS1 game. Since then, I've played Exoddus, Munch's Oddysee, Stranger's Wrath, and New 'n' Tasty. Here's hoping SoulStorm will be another fun adventure ^^

Oddworld: Stranger‚Äôs wrath was my firs game from the series and just love it. It is unique!!

Abe's Odyssey for me was the best,I enjoyed tha mechanics that they introduced back then.

I loved Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee !

Maybe because it was my first one of the Oddworld series!

Abe's Oddyssee made me fall in love, but Abe's Exoddus warms my heart to these days. Love me some Paramite Pie!

Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee has got to be my favorite. I've got tons of nostalgia for it, and the world is just mesmerizing.

Abe's Exodus was my favorite game. I busted the old ps2 out of storage not too long ago, and when I found my games, Abe's Exodus was the first game I just had to pop back in.

Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee

Region: USA, North America

My favorite has got to be Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus. Soooo many memories were made while I played this game with my older brother as an 8yr old. The dark humor, the gore of the death sequences, the farting! This game had it all. From gamespeak, to quicksaving, to a deeper meaning and storyline that makes you think about humanity and our society as a whole (and how corrupt and cut-throat it is), this game has it all. I have so many memories of playing it with my siblings, my cousins, and myself and being absolutely mesmerized by the atmospheric music and the intense, unforgiving world that is Oddworld.

It makes you laugh, it makes you cry, it makes you fart. It's the reason I have a paramite tattooed on my forearm and I wear it everyday with pride! Thanks, Lorne!

When I was a kid, my father worked on the other side of the country. He'd get to come home maybe a couple times a year, and he made a habit of bringing some new video games for us to play. One of those games was Abe's Exoddus. I was too much of a wimp to play very far past the mines, but I loved watching my dad play (and have a few hilarious stories about Mudokons he nearly got killed in stupid ways (\"oops I did drink a brew didn't I\")). It provided the creative spark that got me into writing, a hobby I enjoy to this day. I haven't been a hardcore fan the whole way through (as I never owned an XBox), but I love Oddworld all the same, and I'm grateful for the series' new console-agnostic approach.

Region: North America (USA)

My favorite game would have to be Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee. I have many fond memories of getting the original Xbox, along with the demo of a game. Eventually I would buy the full game when it was released. Me and my step mom would take turns playing through the levels and had a great time figuring out all of the puzzles. We would always try to save all of the mudokons and fuzzles to make sure we have good quarma.

I've loved all the Oddworld games since I was a kid, including Munch's Oddysee, even if it is overall the weakest, but if I had to pick a favorite, I'd have to say Stranger's Wrath. It just has such a cool atmosphere and I really love the story and gameplay. It was a really tough choice between it and Abe's Exoddus, but I personally really enjoy the overall gameplay of Wrath the most.

I live in the US btw :)

Well howdy stranger! My favorite game from the Oddworld team is gonna be Stranger's Wrath. This game had an excellent story and a totally unique play-style regarding the ammo and gameplay. Grew up on Oddworld games and still to this day play them! North America Region, cheers!

Been a long time fan of the series since I was 7 or 8, my favorite game has to be Stranger's Wrath though I have played all releases so far and even have some physical copies. My region is North America.

Munch‚Äôs Odysee has been a favorite of mine for a long time. I have memories of playing with my Dad growing up. It creeped me out for a long time! But I grew to love it.
SE USA

My favorite in the series is Abe's Exodus. Sometimes it makes me so angry how hard it is, but the beautiful cutscenes ground my rage and bring me back to reality. I do not know what I would do without that funky fresh game. (North America HERE!)

my favorite is Oddworld new n tasty and it was a good game my brother got me into the game and it was very fun it is my favorite because it was hard and i enjoyed looking for the secrets also i like how the camera angle was it was unique. (north america) hope i win also thanks for this chance to win this switch it is a big thing to me cause i love the games.

My favorite Oddworld game is New n' Tasty or Stranger's Wrath, there both good, but I think all the games good, I really liked how Stranger's Wrath did something different being a shooter, I know a lot of people disliked the game but I really like it. (U.S.A) (repost I think the first one didnt send

My favorite Oddworld game Stranger's Wrath, but I think all the games are really good, I really liked how Stranger's Wrath did something different being a shooter, I know a lot of people disliked the game but I really like it. It had a lot of enemies and a good story in my opinion. (U.S.A.)

Hope I win :)))))

Abe's Oddesy was the first game I ever played and absolutely loved it! Would love to join the switch adventure with where I started!! Europe here!! üòä

Oddworld: Abe‚Äôs Oddysee has a special place for me. Released while I was in high school, my older brother owned the PS1 and I owned the game. Perfect partnership. I had strange dreams but always came back for more.

North America üôÉ

Abe's Oddesey is my favorite in the series. With Strangers Wrath coming in at a close 2nd. Oddesey is my favorite due to me and my brother mostly him discovering it at a local pawn shop we grew up poor so the pawnshop was a great place to find new games. I remember being so enthralled with the story that I couldn't wait to see where the story went next.

My region is North America.

Thanks for the chance. Maybe now I'll be able to own a switch finally.

My favorite so far was Stranger‚Äôs Wrath. Loved the Sergio Leone vibe. I was really looking forward to The Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot however. Sigh, maybe someday.

Strangers Wrath NA!!!

Oddworld Abes Oddyssey is my favorite, North America region. So much nostalgia, joy, and led me to love the entire series, get the art book collector's edition, and stay a fan for life.

My favorite odd world game is the original. It was hard as heck.

I remember when abes oddysee came out back in 97' my aunt and uncle had it and I would always play it but never get far being a 5 year old. It imprinted itself into my head all my life. Now as an adult it truly is my favorite game series. Abes exoddus is the best game ever made in my opinion I've beaten it more than 10 times now. Still never gets dull. Can't wait to see lornes true dream of my favorite game. When soulstorm is released!!!! Maine, USA

My favorite Oddworld game is Abe's Odyssey on the PS1. It made me fall in love with the futuristic factory aesthetic. Ever since I played that game in my formidable teenage years I've been drawn to films and entertainment that feature factories and rusty industrial settings. Thank you for that! My region is North America (USA).

Oddworld: Abe's Odyssee on PC was my all time favorite. I cannot tell you how much time i spent playing that game.

My region is NA

region midwest my favorite oddworld game is Munch's Oddysee not only my favorite oddworld game but favorite game of all time the gameplay is so unique the cutscenes are crisp for 2001 graphics the story is rich while not being too serious and it always makes me want to know more about the wildlife and natives of mudos i have completed this game more times than i would like to admit due to wanting to see all endings and collect all of the achievements and i am super eager to see what soulstorm is brewing up. in odd we trust. Mark

I'm in the US. I've been a fan of Oddworld since the original Abe's Oddysee on PS1. My favorite, though, might have to be Abe's Exoddus, by a slim margin. I love the expanded story and atmosphere of Soulstorm Brewery. The fart possession mechanic is a lot of fun, too.

Oddworld: Abe‚Äôs Exoddus (I‚Äôm a bit old school) lol but classics you cannot beat

Region: North America

I played Munch's odysee as a kid on the original xbox, I had no idea what I was doing but I have fond memories of the game and nostalgia out the wazoo, it'd be awesome to experience the series as an adult finally.

I would have to say Munch‚Äôs Odyssey would be my favorite but Abe‚Äôs Odyssey hold a special place in my heart. Richmond Virginia

I live in the USA but my heart lies on Mudos. I think Strangers Wrath is probably my favorite, but I have such fond memories of Munch too, and really hope to see him come back in a future game. Long live the quintology!

Abe's odyssey was always my favourite Houston TX

Lorne Lanning is a genius and his series of Oddworld Inhabitants should be ranked up there with Star Wars in Imagination and Innovation! Needless to say I love ALL Oddworld games and they have all remained my favorite console games since their release. CAN't WAIT FOR THE NEW ONE !!! But.. if I really had to pick one, I'd say Abe's Oddysee, because that's what started it all!

I grew up with oddworld as a staple. I lived the characters and world building. The moment I saw I could pre-order strangers wrath I immediately jumped at it. Strangers wrath blew me away and instantly became my favorite oddworld game. The platforming was fun and challenging at times. The shooting felt amazing and the humor reminded me why I always loved oddworld. I also just always had a soft spot for the Grubbs.

United States, Colorado

Oddworld Stranger's Wrath has extremely fun and innovative game play with amazing visuals, glorious settings, steller music, a great story, and interesting characters to follow! Plus the way it expands the world beyond what we saw with Abe and Munch is fun for lore geeks! U.S.A for me

My favorite game has and will always be Oddworld Abes Oddysee! It was a gateway
game for me and over the years has made OW my favorite series, as I hold it close to my heart. I'd hate to admit that I only have strangers wrath on my phone, so a switch version would be way more ideal and easier for me to play!
Good luck to all the entries!
North America, Midwest :)

It's hard to pick a favorite game out of the bunch since all of them are absolutely amazing, but I'd have to say Munch's Oddysee was the one I stuck to the most! I remember playing it on late summer nights when I was younger. I loved the concept of being able to switch between two characters in order to solve the puzzles and find ways to save each other. I've played the game for several hours and multiple times! Kinda hoping for a remake or something with Munch in the future?

North America!

My fav game in the series is by far Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus. It was the first game I ever beat and it has resonated with me from day one to now!

N. America/US üëàüòéüëà

My favorite Oddworld Game has to be the first one I was introduced to at around 10 years old - Munch's Oddysee. The dark ambiance and oh-too-real parallels to factory farming and unfettered capitalism really shaped my worldview. The silly characters (that have much deeper meaning than many realize) seriously drive the points home. And I haven't even brought up the gameplay! Innovative 3D platformer that still holds up near 20 years later, Munch's Oddysee has to be my favorite Oddworld game, though closely followed by The OG (or new'n'tasty). I rented strangers wrath back when that was still an option, and while I had fun with it, I had to return it before I was able to complete much of it. I still have yet to revisit it, but winning this would be the best way to do so!

Region: United States of America

I only recently found strangers wrath and was really impressed with it on the original Xbox. Definitely buying it for the switch and hope we get remastered physical versions of the other oddworld games.

UK PAL region.

Oddysee & Exodus are both my favs, deeply creative and original, with an important story and message to tell. Lorne is hugely inspirational and he's clearly poured a lot of passion into these games. The best cinematic platformers of all time IMO.
FL USA

Strangers Wrath of course! I love the story for this one so much and love being the bounty hunter shooting my fuzzles and other creatures at the bad guys.
[North America]

Oddworld: Abe's Exodus had such an
awesome and unique sense of style and humor that it inspired in me that even I wasn't too weird to create amazing things. That game changed my world at like 13. Love it.
USA - Louisiana - Shreveport.

This is a tough one. I've been playing the Oddworld series since the original on the Playstation. It's a toss up between Oddysee and Stranger's Wrath. I think though I have to go with Strangers Wrath. The mid game twist shocked me. I love how the gameplay switched from then on and bounties were no longer a thing. I felt totally immersed in the world.

North America/New York

The best game to me is Strangers Wrath as I loved the western version of Oddworld. I got it for PC and then bought it again when I bought an old Xbox for some throwback. I am in North America and living in Texas.

My first and favorite Oddworld game is Stranger‚Äôs Wrath. I didn‚Äôt end up beating it until I was a young teen, but I couldn‚Äôt stop playing it once I beat it. I always tried to get all the achievements. (North America)

Oddworld: abe's exodus. Love the hilarious cut scenes. North America

Hey Oddworld and Nintendo! First I want to say Congratulations!! And Awesome!!! I'm from the United States. and Abe Exodus was my favorite of the abe games. The fart possessions, hilarious! The intense challenges of trying to save everyone! I have to say I've play every game! Since high school. Even brought the two mobile games! So happy your making this mobile, and on the Nintendo too.. is there two players? Honestly cant wait for it to come out!! I'm trying to win but if I don't. Just know you still have a loyal fan!
Sendy

ABE'S ODDYSEE! The Sligs always cracked me up as a child. I remember watching my Father try to save every Mudokon the first time I saw it and fell for it enough to try. Abe and Elum are adorable but the Scrabs and Paramytes scared the crap outta me back then lol The \"My Paw\" moon scene always got me.

Abe‚Äôs Exoddus by far! North America

Oddworld Abe's Oddysee I remember playing it or watching my dad play it. Sad he passed in January not even that old either. What can I say the worst year ever the amount of deaths this year is ridiculous

https://www.justgiving.com/...

My fav is the original Abe's Oddysee. Played it on PSOne back when I was about 12/13.

Absolutely loved it, even though it was hard as balls!

I'm in UK, Europe btw

I own several of the games, but the only one I've played so far is the original Abe's Oddysee on PS1. It's definitely a series I need to get around to playing more of.

North America

My all time favorite has to be abes odysee. At that time and to this day has to be one of the most unique games i have ever played. From the gameplay and puzzle solving to the story telling and graphics. It was the first game i ever played on playstation. It will remain in my heart till the day i die. I hope you keep it up and continue abes legacy.
USA here

I got the game Abe‚Äôs oddysee back in late 90s,bought ps1 just to play it.

Strangers Wrath definitely!! Me and my youngest daughter played it over and over again!! Laughing at all the characters, specially the Chippunks!! All the characters : the Clakkers( hey you cut that outüòÇ) , Fuzzle , and all the Outlaws!! We still say some of the lines from the game today!! Love to have a Switch and play this game again. What memories that would bring back!! Love all the Oddworld Games!!

Back in the day Kmart used to sell discounted games without original case just the disc alone. Without having any clue what the game was about, I took Abe's Oddysee vs some racing game for the PS1. Oh boy, I did not sleep for almost a week straight I couldn't put it down. Will always be at heart my fav ‚ô•. USA.

Hey strangers, I‚Äôm so stoked for Soulstorm. I think it will be the most
Amazing odd world game yet! I started playing Abe‚Äôs Odyssey with my father when I was very young, and then Exodus, but I think I really fell in love with the OddWorld universe when I got the Xbox; Munch‚Äôs Odyssey was bundled along with the console so it was all I played for months üòÇ. Favorite OddWorld game? Munch‚Äôs Odyssey, for sure. It felt like an open world game back then and all the new inhabitants were a wonderful showcase. Vykkers labs was such an amazing experience. Take care and please keep making amazing content!
(USA)

Munch's Oddysee is my all-time favorite for childhood nostalgia purposes (and fuzzles are my favorite characters, but Munch is a close second), but I also very much enjoy playing Stranger's Wrath. North America (US) region.

My favorite is still Stranger's Wrath. I also loved Munch's Oddysee. I've never won a contest. This would be amazing. Thanks for bringing us great games across many platforms. Appreciate it. North America.

Abe‚Äôs Odyssey for me. I played it on a demo disc in 97 and loved it so much I still have it now. Dark, humorous, puzzling, platforming, farting fun! Being able to possess sligs and gun down their buddies or just make them spontaneously combust to Abe‚Äôs mischievous giggling was brilliant. I‚Äôm on my second Xbox to carry on playing Munch‚Äôs Odyssey but the original Abe has a special place in my heart.
UK

[USA] I'd have to write an entire essay to even begin to outline everything that I believe makes this series special, and especially what makes this series special to me. My personal favorite has always been Exoddus, with Oddysee closely behind it.

Exoddus manages to smooth out most of the gameplay quirks of the original while improving on the general design in many other areas. Exoddus shines particularly in its cast, where the Glukkon executives steal the show with some of the most memorable cutscenes in the entire series.

One thing both of the original games share is incredible artistry, atmosphere, and aesthetic. I could spend hours staring at each pre-rendered background from both games, every single screen was a work of art. I could go on and on, but I'll cut it short before I ramble. Needless to say, this series holds a very special place in my heart.

I was always a fan of Stranger's Wrath. The living ammo was both really cool and sometimes adorable.
North America

My names Garrett Mahoney, I‚Äôm 27 and I‚Äôm from Alexandria Kentucky. Although I‚Äôve played through all of the Oddworld series, Stranger Wrath takes the prize without a doubt. This game not only implemented unique mechanics like being able to seamlessly switch from 1st to 3rd person but the character development for stranger made it where you couldn‚Äôt put the game down. Stranger, Maybe the last Steef with a secret on a deadly mission to liberate the locals and get their water back! And Fuzzles as ammunition?! What more do you need to know? This game is also my favorite because besides ‚ÄúMunches HD‚Äù and ‚ÄúNew ‚Äòn‚Äô Tasty,‚Äù Strangers Wrath is the most recent new game from the disbanded quintology that is currently being brought back to life, but I‚Äôm hoping SoulStorm becomes my new favorite! Thanks Mr. Lanning for everything and don‚Äôt stop anytime soon! I follow Oddworld on Insta, find me at @Kri8or

Abes oddysee was my favorite because it started the series. I'm us region. In pittsburgh pa.

My favourite is Abe's Exoddus.

The original Oddworld: Abe's Odyssey will always be my faviurite in the series and one of my favourite games ever. So much nostalgia.

I absolutely loved the original PS1 Abe's oddysee, I didn't sleep for three days trying to complete it. And twenty years later I got to introduce my son to it, we're planning a weekend to crack the Switch version. UK

My favorite is Abe‚Äôs exodus! I love the story of the game, and how it perfected the few issues with Odyssey. I‚Äôm so glad to see Soulstorm will be upping the world building and characters of Exodus to bring it to a modern day level.

North America, Ohio.

Munch\"s Odyssey is the best puzzle game ever made. North America here, Florida

My favorite Xbox game as a kid was Munch‚Äôs Odyssey. It was the oddest game I have played till this day. It introduced the idea of having a button that served no real purpose other than pure comedy. The fart button. I will never forget those memories. Looking forward to Soulstorm.

NY, USA

Has to be abes oddysee as played it on PlayStation when I was very young and always struggled with the 2nd level meaning I was pretty baller at the first level as a child from redoing it over and over haha finally completed it as an adult now though
Also from the UK/Europe

Oddworld Abe's Exoddus is my favourite game as it was the first one I finished, and was gifted to me on release for my birthday. I have been addicted to Oddworld games since. I live in Australia

Abe‚Äôs Oddysee is where it all began. To free them all for us seasoned gamers is what makes me so excited to get to visit it all again in the Soulstorm in 2020. I want to get a switch to play more Oddworld games, since i don‚Äôt own one. Im from the USA.

Munch's Oddysee was one of the first games I've ever played on the original xbox. It was creepy and strange and I was always drawn to it's odd world. Recently, after buying another original xbox I revisted the series and re-fell in love. Hopefully my Quarma is good enough for you guys ;) (I'm from Oregon)

My favorite oddworld game is my first wich was my favorite game on ps1, Abe's Oddysee. Loved this game because of all the fantastic creutures in abes world!

I've played oddworld games ever since they came out. I loved the original Abe's Odyssey and Exodus was great. The remake New 'N Tasty was fabulous and only recently been able to play Munch and Stranger's Wrath and all are great. Can't wait for Soulstorm. üòç

Oddworld strangers wrath!

Loved Abes odyssey but luv all the odd world games

Abe exoddus was perfect, from the mechanics, gameplay, and story, actually I can‚Äôt pick an oddworld game they are all unique and great:
From abe‚Äôs oddysee, stranger wrath,
To munch‚Äôs oddysee,
And new‚Äôn‚Äôtasty(thank goodness for this remake)
And we are all waiting for soulstorm,
Thank you for making these games.

I remember playing Abes oddysee on Playstation and laughing so hard with my friends at the sound effects and certain things you could do, i'm sure it had no effect on my sense of humour going forward at all.... was one of the first games i ever owned, fond memories.

Munch's Odyssey, because that angelic playthrough was a fun challenge.
North America

My all-time favorite game in the Oddworld franchise has to be the original Abe's Oddysee. Not only was this my first ever video game to play and experience as a child, around the age of 5, but simply the art style alone was, and still is, so unique. It's also pretty fun for Speed running as well!

United States, Oregon over here! ‚Äπ3

My favorite Oddworlds game is strangers wrath. The creativity and imagination put into by the creators made the experience all the better. I would love to spend some more hours replaying if possible.
Colorado USA/ Rocky Mountain Region

Stranger's Wrath has always been my favorite Oddworld game. I'd always watch my cousin play it when he was younger, and I recently was able to revisit the game. I loved the story and the amount of effort put into world building, a trait shared by all the Oddworld games.

From North America

My first ever game on Xbox was munch's Odyssey

Munch's Oddysee on the OG XBox was the first game of theirs I played and is my favorite, but Stranger is a very close second just for how different it is. Also, the story in Stranger is top notch.

I'm in the USA

The ONLY reason I bought a PS1 was to play Odd world Abe‚Äôs Odysee as a friend introduced me. I was hooked! Hours upon hours after working 2nd shift staying up until the sun rose trying to solve those puzzles. The most brilliant game ever made! Ohio, United States

I'm in North America! I'm new to the series and so I played New 'N' Tasty a couple years back when the game was free on ps plusaPS plus, I'd love to get into the rest of the series! I bought many of the games on pc from gog and I plan to play them all. Can't wait for soulstorm!

Stranger's Wrath is my all time favorite Oddworld game. Such a good gameplay and story.

Oddworld: Abe‚Äôs Odyssey FTW. No matter how much things grow and change, you simply can‚Äôt knock the original.

It's my favorite because it was the first Oddworld game I've ever played

My favorite game was Abe‚Äôs Exoddus. It was the perfect follow up to probable greatest of all time, Abe‚Äôs Oddysee. Oddworld was the only game I played that my older sister would sit down next to me and watch. I grew up near to the original studio and became an illustrator in part because of my admiration for this world and it‚Äôs creators. SLO, CA, USA.

Odyssey!!! My favorite one. I remember as a kid just being amazed taking control of the bad guys.

Ive played every single oddworld since I was a little kid, both of my parents (jason and sandra prather) used to get christmas cards from oddworld every year, it is honestly my favorote game series that gives me nostalgia like nothing else can. Georgia, USA

California, USA here!
Close tie between Oddysee and Exoddus, I've played them both through 15-20 times by now and revisit them every couple years, I look forward to playing them with my own kids someday. I think I've grown more fond of Exoddus as the world and abilities were so much expanded on and the artwork and imaginative world is so incredible it always gets me inspired to push my own artwork further. Thanks for the chance to win!

My first game was the original on PS1. I skipped first grade sentence writing to play the game and it opened my eyes to how the hot dog is made and the effect of industry on wildlife, few other games were even nearly so influential in my belief system. And you just can't beat gamespeak, one of the best abilities in a puzzle platformer. All o' ya!

Hello from the North America/ Pacific Northwest
My favorite Oddworld game is Oddworld Abe's Oddysee.
It was the very firt Oddworld game I played and loved the humor and enjoyed the story of Abe's struggle to gain his freedom.

Can't wait to checkout the new upcoming game on the switch

Oddworld: Abe‚Äôs Oddysey and Exodus! Hands own. But new n tasty was just as good.

My favorite Oddworld Game is Abe's Odyssey New 'N Tasty, and I live in the United States. I've Never been able to play another Oddworld game because I don't have the money when I decide I want to play one of the games, but now I really want to play Munch's odyssey, that game looks epic.

Odd World Abes Exoddus is not only one of the best odd world games but one of the best games ever! Illinois in North America here!

My favorite Odd World game is Abe's Odyssey and it's new rendition, New N'Tasty. Since I was a little girl I used to play the first one with my brother and cousins on the first PlayStation. It was something that we played together as a family which made it more fun. The puzzles and characters made It very enjoyable and I thought it was always hilarious on how they communicate with one another

Munch's Oddysee has always been my favorite since I was a kid playing on original xbox, swimming around, seeing all the fascinating and just /weird/ creatures that've stuck with me all these years. Munch and Abe have just been a huge part of inspiring my creativity for so long, and I adore that I can play with them again on Steam, and now revisit Stranger on the switch!

I'm in the United States but my very first oddworld game was a demo for Abe and Munch's oddysee. Loved the game so much my parents ended up buying me Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath. This game series is amazing and I wish more existed.

Abe's Exoddus is where it all started for me and it will always be my favorite. Arizona / United States

Abe's Odyssey!! First game to get me into the series. And I'm from the U.S.

My favorite Oddworld game is Abe's Exoddus. My uncle had bought the game for me when I was little. He couldn't figure it out, but he knew I could because 'you're smart like that' he would say. He passed away last year from alcoholism. I still own the original PS1 discs and plan to speedrun the Steam version. Much love to you guys <3

Abes oddyssee is my all time favorite. Me and my brother would stay up for hours when we were kids playing the game. The paramites always freaked me out. Oddworld will always have a special place in my heart.

My favorite Oddworld game is Oddworld Abes Oddessey and I live in the United States of America. Me and my brother loved playing Oddworld Abes Oddessey on PS1 back in the 90s as kids. We recently went back and played New and Tasty and had a blast. Good luck everyone!

I love the abe's odyssey and Exodus for its puzzle solving and humour. Oceania

My mom bought me Abe's Oddysee when I was in high school. I had never heard of it and totally fell in love.

My favorite Oddworld game is by far Strangers Wrath because there is no other game like it. The story is interesting and gameplay never gets old. It's in my top 2 games of all time, and it's not #2. From Boise, Idaho

It all started when I played Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee on my PS1 Demo CD. It blew me away--the soundtrack, the ambiance, the characters, and the world design. Abe's Oddysee is, and always will be, my favorite Oddworld game.

North America.

Abe's Oddysee - the first one will always have the strongest (and weirdest!!) impressions in my memory. North America

My favorite oddworld game is oddworld munch's oddysee because I remember it is a child growing up, it was such a fun and unique experience.

From North America :)

Munchs oddesy is the best gane in the series you got to play as both abe and munch with much being just as good as abe.
Reugon England/Europe

I grew up with Abe's Exodus and years later I still like it the most :)
Europe here

My favorite still has to be Abe's Oddesy on ps1. I remember staying up late and taking turns as we died with my brother, he was much better than me as I was younger, but it was great times to cherish. Looking forward to the new adventure! US, New Mexico

I'm in Arizona, USA and my brothers and sister and I grew up on Abe's Oddysee. I remember we saved up and got ourselves the strategy book and would take turns reading each other the levels while one of us played. The secret rooms were my department, the fast jump puzzles were my brother's department, and the long simple stuff was my sister's because she was not very good at video games... lol! Its some of our favorite memories!!

Abe's exodus has been one of my all time favorite games since i was 13 *cough* (just turned 34) *cough* I still have my original ps1 copy complete in box as well as all other Oddworld games that have been released in north America. This would be an amazing addition to my collection! üíöüíöüíöüíöüíöüíöüíö

Munches Oddysee on original Xbox introduced me to the games and will always be my favorite and even the one on gameboy is great as well and I even had stranger which I just recently replayed on mobile too. Unites states, illinois

Hi! Italy here, and I've really enjoyed Munch's Oddysee! The puzzles were fun, and the game mechanics were innovative and cool! I first fell in love with the game thanks to an advertisement on a Pk2 comic issue, I instantly adored the graphics, but unfortunately I only had the chance to play it many years after its release.

Stranger wrath is a must! One of my favourites ever!

Europe :)

Abe and Munch on the original Xbox is my favorite. I used to go over my friends house daily to try and beat it with them. It gave us a great challenge and a lot of fun. I'm in the United States Region

Stranger's Wrath is my favorite one from how it runs in the other direction that most other FPS games follow

I'm from the United States, Texas to be more specific

Oddworld: Abe‚Äôs Odyssey
Region North America (USA)

My favorite Oddworld game is Munch's Oddysee! North America

I've only played some of Abe's Odyssey bit thought it rather rad, and always wanted to give Stranger's Wrath a play bit never could...

PNW in the US

I've loved the game since the first one came out. And because of that, I have to say Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee is my favorite. The main is reason is how new and fresh this game was (and still is) back in 1997. I wish more game developers thought outside the box like this. Can't wait for the next one!!!!!!

I loved the entire oddworld saga but strangers wrath is my favorite! United states here

Oh my god, I've never even thought about which one was my favorite. I think I'd have to go with Abe's Oddysee JUST because it was my first one when I was a kid back in the 90's.

North America

I started with Abe's exodus but strangers wrath is by far my favorite!
North America here

Abe has alway been one of my favorite characters. I even have the Moon fromAbes odyssey (with his hand) tattood on my shoulder. I will have to say Strangers wrath is my favorite still. The Steef was such a cool idea mixed with the western flare. The live ammo mixed with the attitude made this game stand out in the series. I want a new one so bad!

United States here!

My favorite is Oddworld Stranger's Wrath. It had the best game play in my opinion!

North America

My favorite game far and away is New N Tasty. Such a wonderfully brilliant time. NA :)

My favorite game is Strangers Wrath. North America

Gotta go with the original Abe's Odyssey on PS1. I taught myself to whistle by imitating Abe-speak.

NA/USA

Oh man I always wait for new stuff to drop.. Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee and Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath were my favorites! They take you to an ODD world that is as intriguing, as it is mystifying.. I'm located in Bangor, Maine in North America!

Favourite game would have to be Oddysee as it‚Äôs the game I grew up playing with my dad! Region is UK! Good luck everyone!

I've only played Stranger's Wrath on the original Xbox and thoroughly enjoyed it. So I suppose it's my favorite.

US

My favorite memory is playing Oddworld Abe's Exoddus on PC with my friend. We had our computers set up close by and we played at the same time helping each other with tips on the puzzles as we went along.

That was many moduken moons ago.

USA / North America

My obsession for the Odd world series began when I was a wee baern. A friend lent me a PS1 demo disk and the original wa represented, I spent a long time on the speak page and thought it was hilarious. Many years later, I bought the series on steam and the first two on Ps3. Always loved the characters, I think your team is incredibly creative with the designs.

Europe/UK

Both Abes Exoddus and Abes Oddysee, they were like a safe haven compared to the toxic environment that I had at home as a kid. These are my favorite games, because the artwork in the background was so astonishing, the message behind the game was so clear to me even as a kid, the music was perfect. I still listen to it very often.

Also, these games were a great inspiration for me to grow up and become more self reliable. My grandfather introduced me to this games back in 1999 when I was 4 years old, the only thing I could accomplish was making it through the first few screens of the game, probably killing more mudokons than saving them. Now, when my parents divorced, my mom forced me to come with her, away from my grandfather. So he couldnt help me with the game anymore and I was all on my own. I couldnt ask anyone for help so everyday I became more skilled in this game. After a year or so, I made it through Abes Exoddus for the first time (Since it was the easier game of the two). Then i realised, that theres a bad ending if you dont save enough mudokons. So then it took me another year or something to get the good ending. And now, at age 25 I'm trying to get the good ending in Abes Oddysee which is a real pain in the ass at some points still!

Thanks for all the great work and the inspiration, Oddworld Inhabitants! I'm looking forward to buy Strangers Wrath, its the only title that I didnt play yet.

Region: Germany

Old-world Abe's oddessy was the best and where it all started for me with this game absolute banger.

United kingdom

I'd say Munch's Oddysee is my favorite, I loved the game's first step into 3d, the puzzles, the combat, and possessing all of the unique creatures.
North America

Each game has their charms, but I have to go with Abe's Oddysee. That game was revolutionary in so many ways. There had never been anything like it.

(North America)

The original Oddworld Abe‚Äôs Oddysee. I remember the first time I saw the game package back in the 90‚Äôs and instantly knew it would be a classic. I‚Äôve played it multiple times and will keep playing all the Oddworld games over and over again. Love them all! Region:NA

Abe‚Äôs Oddysee changed my perception of video games entirely. New & Tasty is amazing as well!
North America/California

I enjoyed Abe's Oddysee a lot. USA

Gotta go with the classic, Abe's Oddysee! Region is North America!

Abe‚Äôs Oddysee changed my perception of video games entirely. New & Tasty is amazing as well!

The Original Abe's Oddysee, it really hooked me. I remember it also came in this fantastic white box, which opened like a box and it had a nap that outlined areas and creatures in the game. It was fantastic. Australia.

Abe‚Äôs Exoddus is my favorite without a doubt! I still remember the snarky loading screens.

Region: USA

My favorite is Stranger‚Äôs Wrath, it is super fun! I‚Äôm from North America.

Strangers Wrath. Because I love the ammo. Europe.

Back to basic - PlayStation \"Oddworld : L'Odyss√©e d'Abe\" - Europe/France

I absolutely love Stranger's Wrath! I cannot even tell you how many hours upon hours me and my family spent playing this game when it originally came out. We are all super excited to play all the re-releases that are coming out.

Oddworld Abe's Exoddus on PS1 was the first game I ever played at the ripe age of 5 years old, and has always been my favorite. The Oddworld games have been a staple piece in my heart ever since and I absolutely cannot wait for Soulstorm!
Cheers from North America... San Diego California

I played strangers wrath ages ago and it was a blast. Would be awesome to relive that nostalgia.

North America

The original is the best. Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee on my OG Playstation. Can't beat it.

North America

Favourite has to be the original version of Abe's Oddysee, as much as I enjoy Exoddus, New n' tasty etc. I have such a strong nostalgic and emotional attachment to Oddysee seeing as it was my first game in the series. (Australia)

I'm from the US, and I grew up playing Abe's Odyssey on my PC. I was never able to beat it as a kid, but I always loved the atmosphere and the style of the game. I replayed it a few years ago to find that I stilled loved the game and the world it created.

My favorite one is still the first One: Oddworld: Abe's Oddyssey, though I haven't played Much's Odyssey and Stranger's Wrath yet. Looking forward to it! Robert from Europe

I've played Stranger's Wraith on at least 3 different systems and it never gets old. Love it.

North America Region here,
Ive loved oddworld since OGüòç but back then my friend owned abes oddysee and exoddus, so i never got the full experience until my parents bought me an xbox and purchased Munches Oddysee for me. Such an amazing game! And then strangers wrath to follow! I really cant pick a favorite between those two. I own all the games now and im completely ecstatic to play Soulstorm once its here! Please keep making more games.

My favorite Oddworld game will forever be Munch's Odyssey. When I was a kid, I remember telling my brother to buy it at the store because the box art was so cool. Little did we know how invested in the story and complex gameplay we'd get. It was a challenging game for us but the world was literally one of the most bizarre and unique. To this day it is one of the most influential experiences to my own art. Of course, Oddworld Stranger's Wrath is hard not to love, too, for it's extremely powerful twists and push for environmentalism over industrialism. Something this entire franchise consistently comments on in different ways. As for my region, I live in the USA!

Thanks for the game :) Oddworld: Stranger‚Äôs Wrath for sure !!!

Europe / Fr

Abes oddysey, no question. Childhood memories!

My favourite game is OG Oddworld. I sill remember the day I bought it with my mum and played the s*** out of it over and over and over! I also remember buying Munch's Oddysee before I even had the xBox... Australia!

I grew up with the series from Abe's Oddysee onward, but I have to say Stranger's Wrath is definitely my favorite.

Here in the USA

Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus is by far my favourite.

The nostalgia of having to change discs to play the 2nd part of the game. The best due to the odd humour and dark story.

Australia

Unfourtanetely I haven't played any of the games but Stranger's wrath is definetely on my wishlist for me. Hope I win. Europe / England / London

Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus

Greece/Europe

I remember that my parents bought me Oddworld as the first computer game. For me, having a computer at the time as a child was a joy, no one had miracles like me and Abe made an amazing impression on me as a child, he became a buddy to me. I grew up in Poland, which was gray, dirty and communism collapsed, games like Oddworld gave me as a child to move to another world where I could forget about the problems of adults. Thanks to the fact that new versions of old games are being made, I can return to the titles that shaped me as a player. My region is Eastern Europe - Poland

Cool,Cool, cool, best contest...Finally my daughter can meet Abe on the switch!! And I can live again some old school memory from Abe's Exoddus.
Region:Europe

Stranger's wrath is definitely my favorite, played it for hours back in the day.
Asia / South Korea

It's hard to pick just one for me, but I'm gonna have to go with Abe's Oddysee, the game that made me fall in love with Oddworld.
Sweden (Europe)

I played the OG Oddworld, Abes odyssey. I played it on the original Playstation. It was quirky, funny and dark. A great play

I played the hell out of Abe's oddysee on the ps1 and my 4 year old daughter and I bonded on the remastered ps3 version. She called it \"the monster.\"

NA

For me Abe's Odyssey was the game that started the craze, Munch's odysee is probably the one I spent the most time playing and is the most nostalgic for me, that being said Strangers wrath was the most fun and would have to be my favorite.

I never played past the first Oddworld game, but that's all I needed to play at the time. It's a difficult masterpiece.

NA

My favorite game of the Oddworld series is Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty. As far as I have many memories of the first entries, I love how the remake looks. Region: United States / North America

My favorite Oddworld game is Munch's Oddysee. It was the first game I played on the original xbox and to this day it is still one of my favorite games period. I love all of the interesting characters and varied landscapes you explore. It was unlike anything I had seen as a child and it really stuck with me. North America.

Go Go Power Rangers !! Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee the best game :D Europe here :P

I really enjoyed the original Oddworld. Probably my all time favorite. [North America]

Oddworld: Stranger‚Äôs Wrath, i like it because it was the only one I have played haha. On Vita.

My favorite Oddworld game is Munch's Oddysee, it was one of the first games I ever played and so much of it is just baked into my memory.

Grew up with the original Oddysee on playstation!

The original Abe's Oddysee will always be my favourite and hold a
special place in my gaming collection and my heart. One of the first
PlayStation games I owned, many hours were spent playing and replaying
rooms to find and save all the Mudokons possible.

Thanks from Australia

Hello. Follow me. Okay. Nghyyyeeeeh!. *fart* *giggle*
Abe's Odyssey, the OG.

I've only ever played the first two but I'd have to say Abe's Odyssey. USA

Oddworld Munch's Oddysee for sure! America Region.

My favorite oddworld game is definitely the 3d free world roamer as i call but you may know it as, Oddworld Munch's Oddysee. It brung a new factor to the oddworld franchise.A uniqueness in a series of games that can never be reduplicated its one i wont ever forget

My Favorite Oddworld Game is: Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee (1997) I played it on PS1 with my Father and it is a part of my Childhood.

My Region is Europe. I am from Germany.

Stranger‚Äôs Wrath was one of my favorite titels.
Europe / Switzerland

I loved strangers wrath, I‚Äôve played all of the Oddworld games on their original release as a kid with my mom and brother, been a fan forever.
United States here

My favorite one is New N Tasty, and the game name is perfectly choiced ! I don't usually participate but for Oddworld, c'mon !! I want to win this OMg thanks a lot...for everything.

Oddworld Abe's Exoddus, still on my top 10 favorite games list. It‚Äôs an absolute masterpiece.

I've played all the Oddworld games and a huge fan. I even purchased the kickstarted art book recently. With that being said, the original is still the best to me. It was one of the first games to show me games can look like a movie. The other games are great dont get me wrong, but none wouldnt exist if it wasnt for Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee.

Long Island, NY, USA

My favorite is Munch‚Äôs Oddysee, I love the plot and collecting the Gabbits. USA

My favorite oddworld game is new n tasty, I love the humor and character designs
North America here

'Odd World Abe's Odyssey' was one of the first games I played growing up as a child. The character's story arc and how it wove into the narrative forever embedded within me a love for complex story-driven puzzle games. Being able to bring the Odd World series home onto the Switch and travel it with me wherever I go has been an absolute joy. Stranger's Wrath was an exciting departure from the traditional puzzle platformer and further cemented my love for the IP. Thank you for making such incredible games! (Location: United States / North America)

So I think my favorite would have to be Oddworld Abe's odyssey

Oddworkd Abe's Oddysee! Love all oftof art throughout the series.

North America.

I have played every oddworld game and honestly I‚Äôve gotta say that I loved Munchs Oddessy the most. The different enemies you encountered, the levels that you explored were all so exciting and new. I loved the cinematic the most because they were so damn entertaining. I gotta say by the way that my second runner up for my list is strangers wrath. What a unique first person/third person game
With guns that are actually creatures. I played that one constantly and loved all the different ways of capturing or defeatin them varmints!!!.

When I first played an odd world game btw, it was back on the PlayStation. Abe‚Äôs Oddessy. The original PlayStation, and I was little at the time so when it got to the part with the scarab chase, I was so damn frightened! I had to have my big brother beat that part for me!

Keep it up with making these never-forget titles.

Strangers Wrath has always been my favorite. Was very hyped when I saw the original trailers and went to the local best buy day of release to get my copy on the original Xbox.

Region: North America

Abe exodus was my thing. Hope this is nice too. Europe region

Hand's down, Oddworld Strangers Wrath is my favorite. I like the entire series but Stranger's Wrath was way ahead of its time. I would LOVE to see a sequel. (North America)

I grew up, playing oddworld: abe's oddysee
And i absolutely lover everything about it!
After 20years i still enjoy playing everything and even lovend the other games, but oddysee will always be my true favorite!

Much f love from the Nederlands, europe

Been playing these games with my dad since I was a little kid. My favorite in the series was the original Oddworld: Abe's Odyssee (though Stranger's Wrath was way up there too). I once tweeted at Lorne how much we appreciate the Oddworld universe- it is such a unique and spiritual concept.

It really meant a lot that he responded the way he did, too. Anyway thanks for doing this, it looks awesome!

Abes Oddyssey for terrifying me as a child and becoming my favourite game afterwards üòÇ I'm in Ireland!

My Favorite Oddworld game by far has to be Abe's Exoddus, there is just something about the scale of the game and the idea of soulstrom brew that i just love

out in Australia here

I'm from the US and I've played every main line game in the series since my childhood except for Abe's Exodus. This whole franchise has my favorite video game universe and it has always had a special place in my heart. From all the memories I made solving puzzles and platforming in Abe's and Munch's Oddysee, to collecting bounties with Stanger in Stranger's Wrath, to reliving them all over again in New N' Tasty and the remasters of Munch's Oddysee and Stranger's Wrath. Even if I don't win the giveaway, I'd like to thank Lorne Lanning and everyone at Odd world Inhabitants for the great memories, amazing world building and storytelling, and for all of you guy's hard work. I'm looking forward to the future projects you guys have in mine and I'm very excited for the release of SoulStorm!

My favorite Oddworld game is Abe's Exoddus. I love Fleeches and their backstory. I remember I used to imitate Abe trying to sneak through them when I was still a kid. Super excited for Soulstorm!
United States / North America

I don't really have a favorite game in the oddsworld series as I've enjoyed my time with all of them! However, Strangers Wrath has a special place in my heart

North America/ United states is my region

My favorite was Oddworld Abe's Exodus, played on my old PC, I have the CD until this day.
North America region, but just for the codes

I played old Oddworld game back in the day when i was a kid and recently Oddworld New 'N Tasty. It was really fun! Europe/Greece here!

I'd have to go with the classic oddworld abe's oddysee! Love all the games though just played that so much as a kid so it wins from nostalgia purposes! Can't wait to play more, I'm also in the USA! Good luck everyone! :)

Oddworld New N Tasty üíØ

USA

My favorite is probably Stranger's Wrath but I enjoyed all of them so far.
I'm in the US.

Oddworld has been a consistent inspiration throughout my entire life. The visuals that Raymond Swanland created mixed with the gritty/brutal satirical uniqueness of the Oddworld universe is still to this day one of the most original IP's ever created in my opinion. I became a professional illustrator hugely in part to Oddworld and its inhabitants. From Abe's Odysee to Strangers Wrath, each game is a pure testament to top of the line character concepting, world building, and some how mashed with super entertaining game mechanics. LONG LIVE THE SLIG CHUCKLE!!!!!!!!!!!

Cheers from the PNW/ North America!

My favorite was Oddworld Abe's Oddyssey. Remember playing it when I was still living with my parents. But a big fan of New N Tasty too.
North America here !

My favorite Oddworld game has been Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath, which I've recently replayed and still holds up as one of my top games. I live in NA

Tbh oddworld abes oddeysee was the first game i have everplayed, it holds a special place in my heart, easily making it my fave. North america

My favorite is definitely still Abe's Oddysee! That game completely captured my imagination. I was a little kid when I played it so because of how strange and absurd it looked when I first saw it, I thought it was some kind of \"Halloween game\". I love how each screen is practically a puzzle but still ties into this fast paced beat, keeping you on your toes while leaving you immersed in this sense of being on the run and constant danger. The messages of the game, like the whole series, prove even more relevant today than then too. The world is certainly odd.

Florida (send help)/United States

The original two Abe games were my absolute favourite ps1 games and although I enjoyed New and Tasty, I always go back to those original games.

And have a heart attack when the crow makes a noise when you load up.

And my partner and I still use the whistles as pass words to each other.

I‚Äôm in the UK (Europe region) and love the wooden effect on the joycons!

Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty for sure. My husband's love for the first Abe's Odyssey got me interested when we found an Oddworld game for PS4 and I've been a fan ever since.

My last entry got reported as spam so just gonna try and repost it again.

Where do I start with the immersive and talented world of Lorne Lanning.

Not only did the oddworld franchise age like the finest wine from their groundbreaking game design of Abes Oddysee, breaking the norm of how games can be both artistic pieces with a beautiful narrative with brain mongering puzzles. But the world that they created, through seamless cut scenes, is the most wondrous and fleshed out pieces of media I've ever experienced. The art book that was released does nothing but open the entire OddWorld up more and gives it that extra layer of heart.
Abes Exodus being released a year afterwards, and with an expanded gameplay shows how talented the team was to build something just as strong as Abes Oddysee with a more detailed design with an intricate map to follow.
Munch's Oddysee, being one of Xbox's opening titles was probably the biggest graphical amazement I couldn't even dream of from happening. The 3D landscape alone allowing you to explore OddWorld was what was opening to be craved for, to really get the detailed view of how the world had evolved and where it came from. The absolute charm of Munch and Abes relationship, really captivating you as you grow with them through countless hurdles. Learning the business world of the Glukkons, how they compete for total monopoly and how the hierarchy of the Glukkons determines their overall wealth, in complete comparison with how the real world works.
Strangers Wrath, a completely fresh and new story line, taking the OddWorld environment into this encaptured evolved Red dead Revolver like scenario. A world that's always felt more alive and full of life. With every small creature being free-roamed to use as ammo, the bountys being their own storyline by themselves, resembling characters from previous titles, while having, again, fantastic level design that revolves around the brilliantly crafted game play, only enhancing the experience even more so.
And finally, New 'n' Tasty. A fresh new look at the one that started it all. To take something that, even now, holds the test of time and juice it up into this mind boggling graphical leap. It's something that's very rare to see, the pure heart and essence of something so special be made to look and feel better than the original, the creator still attached to their amazing work like this just shows how the developed world has and always will be in the right hands.

The entirety of OddWorld is one of the pieces of any media I am always so thirsty and eager to see because it is perfect in my eyes. It is the perfect balance of art, storytelling and gameplay. Every piece that's come from the company has been a revolutionary masterpiece. Even following the development of the new game has been super exciting to witness. You're forever learning about this insane amount of world building and every drop of it is delectable.
If you were to show me the character designs alone from OddWorld, singularly I'd demand an immersive world that shows who these characters are and how they all effect each others lives.

Munches Oddysee is my favorite because it does that perfectly. It takes this developed place that we've seen before and completely opens it and lets the story on top of it change it, use it and unravel from it. To me it held a place where it became a friend because you grow with Abe and Munch. And at times you feel as vulnerable as they are, and they overcome together. I remember the first time playing it back in 2002 and I really don't think anythings had me on edge as much as that ending since. Drawing below by me

Thank you Lorne Lanning and the rest of the OddWorld team for being an artistic endeavoring machine and a reliable staple of the entire gaming industry.

I live in Wisconsin, America

Abe‚Äôs Oddysee and Abe‚Äôs Exoddus are still my favorite two, but such a fun series overall! Someone broke in to my apartment in college and took my PlayStation, but LEFT my games including the Oddworld games, so it sucked, but at least the games remained! Still have both! ‚ô•Ô∏è

USA here!

I loved the original Oddworld game on PS! Spent many hours playing it and saving the inhabitants.

ODDWORLD New N' Tasty was the best Oddworld game for me because it was a remaster of the original game I played as a child which was awesome, the graphics was beautiful and the gameplay was amazing. I live in the United States

Abe odysee is my favourite and the reason i've played every oddworld game following it, New Zealand

Abe's Exoddus, 100%

USA

I remember taking a chance on some random game I had never heard of and spending the next year trying to 100% it. Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee was a huge part of my childhood and some of the funniest and most frustrating deaths ever.

the switch version of stranger's wrath was my favorite! I'm from America and would love to win this one!

I started the series when Abe‚Äôs Oddysee hit the PSX, and was hooked since then. Grabbed posters, shirts, and anything else I could, and after a recent playthrough of Stranger‚Äôs Wrath, I‚Äôm gonna have to go with that as being one of the most impactful moments to me with the series.

Though, my favorite memory is going to E3 in...2004, I think, and getting a chance to meet Lorne. I asked him to do the voice, and in Abe‚Äôs voice, he just looked and me and said ‚Äúwhich one?‚Äù.

Can‚Äôt wait to see the future of the series, to play Soulstorm, and to see if Fangus and The Hand of Odd ever manifest themselves for us to be able to enjoy. I hope so, because Oddworld may be literally the only series I‚Äôve ever played that‚Äôs still batting 1.000.

I loved Stranger's Wrath on the Xbox, although I'm sad to say I never finished it! I didn't own an Xbox so I could only play it at my buddy's place.

I'm in North America, US. This would be a great way to finish the game üòÇ

United States. My favorite Oddworld game has always been Munches Odyssey <3

I‚Äôve never played any but I would love to. North America.

Oddworld has always been a big part of my childhood, Abes Oddysee was my first obviously and was one of the first games I saw the ending of, And Strangers Wrath came out during a very confusing time in my life so I played it quite often. I bought an xbox from a garage sale just to play it even back then. Region is north america

I love Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus! USA

I remember getting Munch‚Äôs Oddysee back on the original Xbox and man, what a game that was. The series is really a winner in my book and I‚Äôm excited to play on switch. If I got the Oddworld edition...now that would be playing in style

I‚Äôm in North America!

The ODDEST game imo is Abe‚Äôs Exxodus. It expanded upon the first‚Äôs quirky formula, while innovating with the perfect additions.

I‚Äôm from Oregon, USA.

Game on!

My favorite game is absolutely, without a doubt, Stranger's Wrath. I played this game back when I was in preschool, my parents taking it away when they became worried it might spark \"violent behavior\" in their child. Years later, I got it back and the first thing I did was find the clucker next to the infinite fizzle supply, hitting him with those until I passed out from laughing and left the xbox on all night long (Maybe they had a point...). Back then, I never spent enough time in a playthrough to reach the \"halfway\" point. I finally made it there when I was old enough to interpret meaning from works, and I can honestly say that the climax and ending of this story were the very first \"story\" I've ever been emotionally connected to. All I hope for now is that this game gets a sequel, no matter how impossible that may be.

North America Here.

My favorite oddworld game was the very first one. Oddworld: Abe's oddysee. I remember playing it for the first time while i was a kid. It was quite eerie for me as i was a 7 year old kid trying to sneak past my brother just to play ps1. Did not quite finish it as i was just a kid but somehow enjoyed it without them even uttering a single word. It was quite nice and I would love to play a new installment in the franchise.

New Zealand

One of the first games I ever played in my life was Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee on my very first computer as a kid so that has to be my favorite.

USA/North America here!

Definitely has to be Abes Oddysee! It was my first so it will always have a special place in my heart. I'm in North America!

Strangers wrath. Really cool game. Can't stop playing it!
Greece / Europe

Strangers Wrath and I am located in New York New York USA

Strangers wrath is by far the one that i really enjoyed! Europe here!

Oddworld Abe's Exoddus is literally my favorite game of all time. I'm also from Spain, specifically Madrid :)

Abe's Oddesey was the first console video game I ever played so when I got my own ps2 the first game I got was Abe's Exodus which is still my favorite video game of all time. North America NYC here.

i remember playing Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee first as demo from ps magazine then brought it.. sadly couldn't keep up with the series cause of the lack of concole.
eh,that bring backs memories ^^ anyways never forgot that game looking foward to play the game in the future

Poland/europe

UK here, my favourite had to be Munch's oddysee, though Abe's Exodus was such a leap in so many areas from its already amazing predecessor that I wouldn't argue anyone that chooses that as their favourite.

There's a few factors that lead me to pick Munch's Oddysee as my favourite from the series. The main reason would be the jump to a 3D Environment. The change from 2D to 3D gameplay is drastic for obvious reasons, however the developers not only managed to cram almost all the features from the previous titles, but also found new 'n' tasty ways to spice up the gameplay too - with a multitude of powerups, swimming, the interactivity between the strengths and weaknesses of the playable characters, environmental hazards (for example the \"recycling fan\") and so on.

Before I end up writing a full review here, I think I'll just summarise.

This unique and loveable game is full of interesting and diverse characters that overlay a well written and enjoyable narrative, with fun gameplay and set in a mysterious and truly Odd World. It's not perfect, but to me this adds to the charm of it. The best game (for me) in a series of absolutely fantastic and undeniably groundbreaking games.

Mr Lanning and team - you're awesome.

(Europe)

Stranger‚Äôs Wrath

North America here.

I'd say my favorite is Munch's Oddysee. It's a silly thing to say, as I truly love every Oddworld game, and have played all of them multiple times. Munch's Oddysee, though, I've played what feels like 50 times over, either Angelic or Black quarma. It was my introduction to the Oddworld franchise. I'll never forget running past sligs and explosions, walking through with armies of Fuzzles or Mudokons, being intimidated by the massive structures and factories that laid before me.

I'm even creating my first ever Minecraft mod based on the vendos from the game. To say I love it is an understatement.

I'm in the United States. My favorite game would be OddWorld Munches Odyssey. I love the back and forth style of gameplay and the fact that we got too see the more in-depth culture of all the races in the universe.

Would love to give it a try! Heard about Oddworld for awhile! Region: North America

Oh man, I've grown up playing the Original on the first Playstation. And while Stranger's Wrath was an amazing game, I have to go with New 'N Tasty because it brought back so many childhood memories.
North America

Honestly OG Oddworld is my favorite. It was just such an interesting and strange game. It left a huge impression on me when I was very young.

I‚Äôm in the us

Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus. The original is still the best IMO

Strangers Wrath was my jam as a kid. I was so shocked to discover who the bad guy was and I super wanted a sequel. Totally still on the table yeah? :)
Australia

Abe's Odyssey is my favorite but I love them all so much. North America New Mexico

Oddworld Abe's Oddysee was one of the only games I had on my computer growing up (And One Must Fall:2087, Uplink, and Chips Challenge) Me and my brother spent hours upon hours playing that game, New and Tasty then became the first game I bought for my PS4, and Oddworld:Soulstorm will become the first game I ever pre-order, I have been waiting for this game since I was 8 years old. I want a Nintendo Switch to play these remasters as they are only available in PSNow for me. I cant wait!

Canada here (Ontario), not sure if I can get the giveaway here but would LOVE IT.

If it wasn't clear, Abe's Oddysee is my favourite. Still in Canada, haha :)

Gameplay wise its exoddus, but odysee and stranger are close enough. Greetings from the United Kingdom.

My favorite has to be Abe's exoddus. There was just so much in it and so many things to do it was overwhelming. I'm glad that I got into the series and if it wasn't for caddicarus I think I would have passed this game up. New n tasty was amazing and to see soul storm made me want to cry in joy but I digress Abe exoddus is my favorite

Usa over here ;)

My favorite game is Abe's Exoddus, and I've been a fan from the original launch. I love the soundtrack to Exoddus so much, and all the puzzles are still challenging to me today.
Pennsylvania, North America.

NAE pennsylvania, exoddus was my favirite because of all the cool things about it. Like being able to control farts, glukkons and flying sligs made it so much fun. And i definitly think FLEECHES were the creepiest thing in the game.

I loved playing all of the Abe's games, they were the reason I even got an Xbox. But Strangers is probably my all time favorite game. Still play it today. My kids love the fuzzels.

North America

I remember getting to Abe's Exodus in 98' at our local mall in Tel Aviv, Israel. Just the cover with the soda and this creature was so fascinating to me at the age of 11.
The first thing I remember is the shock in the game itself when Abe finds out he's been making brews out of his own people. In retrospective, this was one of the roots that led me to stop eating meat later on in my life.

I remember the game being influential to me as a gamer who played puzzle games before, but the combination of puzzle and platform with the stressing timed action sequences was something I haven't experienced before.

After I finished it, I went and played the first Oddworld and enjoyed it as well.

Middle East, Israel.

Abe's Odyssey was my favorite but I really love them all. North America New Mexico

To be honest, my favorite Oddworld game is Abe's Oddysee. It was a lovely, different, hilarious, and insanely creative vision that without it, this amazing franchise wouldn't be around today!

Texas, USA here!

Stranger‚Äôs Wrath is probably my favorite.
North America region.

Strangers wrath, I remember seeing it on xplay back when I was a kid. I love cowboy movies and the universe everything was in since munch's oddysee. so put cowboys in there and I'm in. north america.

I loved munch‚Äôs odyssey! I was of the first games I played when I got my ps2. I‚Äôm in North America.

My favorite game is Munch's Odyssey on the original Xbox! We used to play it all the time. Even today my family all still quotes the things that Munch and Abe would say. \"Get em!\" \"You better stay here\". We also refuse to eat caviar!

USA

Have to go with the OG Abe‚Äôs Oddysee, game is amazing and loved everything about it.

Easily mine is STRANGERS WRATH, it comes off as such a silly funny story on the surface but like all oddworld games it hides a deeper moral lesson about corporate level evil in the world. Parts made me cry as a kid; I‚Äôve recorded 2 episodes but I plan to record YouTube videos of me playing the whole thing along with Munch and Soulstorm!

First game played it was Abe's Odyssey and I loved it.

I am from Europe üôÇ

Oddworld: Abe‚Äôs Oddysee back in 1997. I took a chance on buying that game as I knew nothing about it back then and am so thankful I did. Been a huge fan ever since. Loved Abe‚Äôs Exoddus, Munich‚Äôs Oddysee, Stranger‚Äôs Wrath and New ‚Äòn Tasty. Highly looking forward to Soulstorm which will be why I will be buying a PS5. North America here, specifically United States.

Odd world new n tasty for ps1 was one of my earliest memories of gaming when yall brought it back to ps4 I was ecstatic..excited to see the series continuing with next gen

Hi there, I never had a chance to play full game always curious to play it. I had a Nintendo Switch meanwhile and love this theme. Its very original and quiet unique in fact. I would like to have some chance to play! Well, I'm from Portugal,Europe.

Abe's Exoddus. It took everything great about the first and pumped it up to 11.
And come on, exploding farts.
North America.

I fell in love with the original Abe‚Äôs Odyssey years ago. It blew my mind with prerendered cutscenes blending into the levels as I play. It was so immersive, with all the creatures and great sound effects, and the story. Plus Abe was hilarious, running like an idiot in the night. I love a good underdog story.

North America

I LOVE strangers wrath as well as Abe‚Äôs oddesy. And munchies oddesy I love all the games. I have been playing them since I was a kid. I am from America. New England area.

While I began the series on Abe's Oddessy, way back in the first PlayStation, my favorite came along years later in the form of Stranger's Wrath, which I played on Steam. For me, Stranger was an Oddly adorable, relatable, and interesting character that I connected with. I just loved the way he talked, too! His story and how he was treated moved my heart. (P.S. I have been REALLY hoping for a sequel, too! ü•∫)
.: Florida, United States :.

Strangers Wrath was the 1st Oddsworld game that I played back on the original xbox had good time playing and re-playing it on the switch so many good memories.
Puerto Rico/United states

I need this in my life. The nostalgic feeling of runnin through rupture farms to save my fellow overworked Mudokons with a hello or follow me with nothing but rocks and spoiled meat to avoid the peril that awaited us if you got caught was the most stressful and satisfying things to do in a game that I have ever played. This was the dark souls of my time and I have played every single oddworld game produced. I would arguably put this platform at the very top of my list of games that will make you rip your hair out as well as have u fully committed to see the end. ‚ù§Ô∏è -Texas, USA-

I was 7 years old when I first played Munch's Oddyssey. MytMy lateIlate fatherwfather took meime totto a gameOgame store where I was given permission to pick up a game. I fell in love with this game I've never heard about and had such a beautiful front. I quickly fell in love with this weird world filled with awkward looking heroes and villains as I kept playing. I got to play all of the other games as the years passed. Munch's Oddyssey is my favorite tho, since it holds a very special place in my heart. Always takes me back to a very special place. I thank you guys for the experience.

What an awesome looking Switch. I've never gotten the chance to play, but just looking at this changes my mind :)

Started on Exoddus and Odyssey, always been a big fan. Takes me right back to my childhood. The Scrabs are my favourite creature! They scared me as a youngster but now I love them!

Wales, United Kingdom

I was a very young kid when Abe's Oddysee came out but I played the hell out of it. Never ended up beating it until I was about 12 or so. I've played and beaten every game in the franchise since countless times and I'm so excited to play Soulstorm!
I'm from the US

I played Oddworld New 'N Tasty on mobile sometime ago (NA)

I have fond memories of playing Abe's Oddysee on the PS1 as a kid.
MI, USA

\"Oddworld: Abe's exodus\" of course.

Spain/europe

I played the original Abe's Oddysee with my sister in the nineties. We really bonded over it, and would regulary recite the lines from the opening sequence of \"This is Rupture Farms...\" to each other. I have such fond memories of this game, especially nowadays with my sister's health being poor. For these reasons, it has to be my favourite Oddworld game.
- Nicolas from Australia

Stranger‚Äôs Wrath hands down! North America

My favorite is Oddworld New N Tasty.From Ukraine / Europe!!!

Abe's Oddysee will always be special. Of course the puzzles and gameplay are awesome, but what mattered most at the time.. Farts. (NL/EU)

Czech Republic (Europe) here! My favourite game of yours has got to be Abe's Exoddus. When I was 4 years old my dad gave me a PS1 for my bday, and Abe's Oddysee with it. I absolutely loved it!! I was very scared of Abe showing up in the menu, cause my little mind thought he could jump out of it and appear in my room. I finished Oddysee and then, next year, dad gave me Exoddus. It felt like it improved on every level and there's little to no games that made me feel like that. :)

I haven't played any of the Old-world games yet, but when the announce for the new one (Soul storm) we as shown during the ps5 presentation. I couldn't wait to play it.

Back to the 1st farts: Abe's Oddysee
From France

Pacific Northwest, USA here!

I have always adored the original Abe's Oddysee. I still go back and play the PS1 copy routinely...the sound effects, the music, the world and the sublime ridiculousness reaches deep into my heart and evokes the most wonderful and weird nostalgia. I'm so grateful for the influence of these games on those who got to play them and I can't wait for the next installment! Go Oddworld Inhabitants, go!

My game of choice is Abe‚Äôs Exoddus I remember playing it on a demo disk and then we got it for real, I‚Äôm collecting the ps1 games brand new!

I also love original Oddysee, tough choice!

United Kingdom, England, Northumberland :)

Oddworld: abe‚Äôs exoddus has to be by favorite game in the series. A really well made sequel to an already fantastic first entry of the series. (commenting from Greece)

I have really fond memories of Abe's Oddysee and would love to try one of the remakes! (Australian code for me, please ;-)

My favorite is Oddworld New N Tasty. I really love that game! It is super. My region is Greece, Europe. Thank you for this contest. The present is so so so great and beautiful! Hope that I will win it! <3

I have had the pleasure to play all the Oddworld games so far and in my opinion exodus was my favorite. I love the variety of creatures you can encounter in all the Oddworld games and how tough it can be to make sure you save every last mudoken hidden away in every nook and cranny of the levels.

The one for me has to be the original Abes oddysee ‚ÄúHello‚Äù. My all time favourite, I spent hours playing this. Takes me right back. From trying to escape the rupture farm to Abes chanting and the birds when taking over the slig that I always found strangely satisfying. And the great pleasure to watch Mullock get electrified in the board room. Amazing game, needs a remake. Love this game.

Michael from England

Picking your favorite Oddworld game is like picking your favorite child, they all have their own identity, themes, and gameplay. But if I had to pick it would be Munches Odyseey. The gameplay is always fun and it's pretty accessible even to people who haven't played Oddworld which is why I always recommend playing it first, and I just love the music and Munches character
United States

I've played both exoddus and oddysee and to be honest, I'm not sure which I like the most. I would say that Oddysee because it is the first I played and the one I am more nostalgic about, but i love the gameplay improvements of Exoddus

In the end, I think I like Oddysee just a little bit more

Spain/Europe here!

My favourite will always be Abe's Exoddus. Played the game as a kid so it was difficult enough for me :D. would love a remake/remaster of exoddus to relive the nostalgia again:)

Europe/Netherlands.

Europe >> Belgique

I've never played an Oddworld game, don't know where to start if I did get the chance to play one. I think I ended up with Abe's Odyssey on Steam at one point but I haven't gotten around to it yet. Don't know if that disqualifies me but I'll toss my region just in case.

[North America]

Going back to the original. Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee. Australia/NZ region.

Abe's oddysee is still my favorite game of all time. Huge fan of oddworld inhabitants, Lorne lanning and Sherry mckenna. My dream is to someday meet you all. Please never stop what you're doing. You guys have truly shaped the way I see the world and helped me become a more empathic man. Lorne please take care of your health, the world needs more people like you. I hope someday Lorne writes a book, as well as Sherry. Love you guys, please take care of your health and wishing you happy days. Thanks for all the games and interviews over the years and artbooks. Looking forward to soulstorm!

USA version

Gotta be strangers wrath. Was so happy to find out it was coming to the switch. What a great game to play on the go to at home :)

Definitely Abe's Exoddus, but New 'N Tasty does it justice.

Munches oddysee was my first game I ever purchased! Also stumbled upon the Gameboy version of Abe's oddysee I believe it was,long time ago! North America here :)

It has to be the original on the PS1. I played the demo over and over again trying to perfect it. To be honest as a kid the best part was the ability to fart. !*!Europe!*!

I have only played Oddworld New, N Tasty, I've definitely enjoyed that game and actually went to platinum the game on PS4, but decided I'm not worthy lol. I seen the trailer for the new game and thought it looked cool (and I am probably gonna buy it). I'd love to have the Nintendo Switch :)

- Europe please :)

Strangers Wrath was the BOMB! I remember first hearing about it from X-Play on G4. Man the memories. Region: North America.

Oddworld abes exoddus was my childhood i never had a memory card so I used to start again each day , I absolutely loved taking over a slig making them set a trap on themselves but the real truth is i just love oddworld i have the collectors art book and all 5 games mutiple times spanning from PlayStation to xbox.

Rugby warwickshire, England, Europe

Munch's Oddysee was my first Oddworld game, and probably my favorite. Although, Soulstorm does look really nice so far. North America.

I was actually never really into platform games... untill Oddworld arrived on the PS1.
Not only was I hooked, it was also one of the very first games I actually finished :-)
Ever since I‚Äôve been a huge fan of everything ‚ÄúOddworld Inhabitants‚Äù

location: Europe

North American fan here & Stranger's Wrath is really my favorite of the bunch, though i love all the Oddworld entries. I think SW really surprised me with its story in a way I hadn't expected, and I really didn't want it to end, but it did...and oh so rewarding an experience it was.

Oddworld abe's oddysee is my top favourite. Remember so much from this game. Region: Europe

i loved abes exoddus the most. the more vast levels, the secrets, quiksaving! i cant wait to see what they do next with soulstorm

europe/england

Lloyd from Melbourne(Australia) lockdown here. I have find memories of playing Oddworld on PlayStation (PSOne), was my first real Metroidvania which made me love the genre despite not having being called that back in 1998! Would love this prize and have something to do :-)

Definitely loved Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus, however, both the original games on the PS1 were my childhood! They were so fun!

USA!

Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee was a classic!!

I'd have to say Strangers Wrath. I just love the whole atmosphere.

USA

First one I ever played was Abe‚Äôs Exoddus. Fell in love with everything involved. Munich‚Äôs Oddysee came out on Xbox a couple years later but I wasn‚Äôt able to get an xbox for a few years...that was an eye opening experience when it finally happened. So cool, but I miss Abe.

USA

I loved Oddworld Strangers wrath, the shooting system is really fun and love the difference in ammunition

Australian region!

Stranger's Wrath is probably my favorite next to munch's odyssey been a fan since watching my older brother play Abe's games on the PS1
North America, U.S.A, Kansas

Hello! I first saw Munch's Oddessy on the shelf as a kid and begged my mom for it. I fell in love with the art and when I was able to process the story, I finally finished the game and then played all the others. Except for Stranger's Wrath, until I was able to play it on my friend's switch. Munch is still my favorite character and favorite game. I thought The Fuzzles were adorable and hilarious and I often drew them on my school papers lol. Thank you guys for the amazing games and all the hours of fun! Can't wait to see what you've got for us in Soulstorm! Much love everyone! <3 -Adam in Kansas, United States

I played Oddworld Abe‚Äôs Oddysee back when it was on PlayStation Probably around 1996 or 1997,and I have very fond memories playing with me and my younger brother , we would both combine our ideas on how to figure out the puzzles together it was a great bonding experience, and I remember we were both extatic when we found out about Abe‚Äôs Exoduss coming out we mowed so many lawns just to get that game but it was so worth it , hours and hours of fun

I am in the United States , Texas to be exact

New and nasty has to be my favorite! I‚Äôve replayed it more times than I can remember! Even have it on my tablet now. Love all of them though. You guys are awesome for all that you bring to these games! Can‚Äôt wait to see more from you!!! Region is United States.

I remember playing Oddworld since I was young. The humor in it and the difficulty it had. The first one I beat tho, was Strangers Wrath on the original Xbox. I remember my brother struggling with the game, and being annoyed at the fact I was beating it with ease. Proud moment, not gonna lie.

North America.

I have played all of them and love the quirky humour and puzzles they portray. Strangers Wrath is my favourite, it was such a well designed game and the humour and characterisation was impeccable. I‚Äôm in the UK

Munch's Odyssey really got me into the series when I was younger with it's unique style, but my favorite is Stranger's Wrath for sure. It has the Odd World unique style while feeling like a unique game that no one has really made anything similar.
USA

Stranger's Wrath has always been my favorite oddworld game üò≠ I've played it through and through more to l times than I can remember, and the soundtrack always hits me in the feels

USA here, Colorado üòä

Mine has to be Abe's Odyssey on the PS1. It was the first one I played and to this day, my family and I still make references to that game in our interactions :) I remember it being so hilaaarious that you could fart, at will, in a video game lol

Region: US, NA

Munch's Odyssey was my first Oddworld game and is my favorite! üòç I'm in NA

Region North America. It's hard to pick a favorite. I really can say I've loved every Odworld game I've played. The characters and stories suck me in! I think Stranger's Wrath was my favorite though, the \"live ammo\" concept brought me in out of curiosity, and the plot ending blew me away!!

Just got a new apartment and my fiancee just mentioned wanting a switch for our new living room. This would be perfect.

Very hard pressed between Abe's Oddysee and Exoddus. The world design, atmosphere, music, humour... unparalleled and equally awesome. Favorite games of all time, no competition. I'm an oddworld inhabitant from Europe!

Munch's Odyssey was my favorite. North America

Honestly, I have loved all Oddworld games, but Stranger's Wrath does hold a special place in my heart when my dad and I used to play it together on the original Xbox.

Oddworld strangers wrath!!!!! NORTH AMERICA USA

My favourite Oddworld game would have to be Abe‚Äôs Exoddus as it truly was the greatest sequel in gaming history and my favourite game of all time. (Australia Region)

Abe's Exodus was by far my favorite! munch's odyssey is a VERY close seccond love all of Abe's adventures though, they are a staple in my game collection.
-Nick Karras from Pennsylvania, USA - North America

My favorite Oddworld game is Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee for Xbox. It was the first game in the Oddworld series in 3D and I loved playing it on the original Xbox. Region: North America

Ive been playing oddworld games since i was 4 or 5 years old. My favorite would definitely be either strangers wrath or munches oddyssey. Loved the 3D. (North America)

I've only played the one for the gameboy, Oddworld Adventures

North America

Abe's Exoddus is my favorite of the bunch, it has the best gameplay. I just played a 100% to prepare for playing Soulstorm!

(North America)

There really was only one great game and that was Oddworld: Abe's Exodus I remember playing it for the first time. All those years later when it re released on PS4 I was instantly grabbing it.

Thanks for the giveaway, never played Strangers Wrath

New Zealand

The original Abe's Odyssey is my favorite. It was just so interesting at the time

North America

I‚Äôve loved the whole series since the beginning, playing Abe‚Äôs Oddysee on the PS1. The original and Abe definitely hold a special place in my heart though. [North America]

My favorite game is Munch‚Äôs Odyssey because Munch is too darn cute not to love! :) All the games are honestly all so wonderful, but Munch just does it for me!

North America!

I own all of the main console OddWorld releases and wish we could have seen more installments over these years. I especially enjoy the original OddWorld: Abe's Oddysey on PS1. I can't explain what Drew me to the OddWorld franchise. My first was Munch's Oddysey but I had to run it back and see what Abe's story was about. Since then, I'm hooked.

Easily Stranger's Wrath. I played that game front to back a dozen times with my dad when I was younger!

My favorite Oddworld game is Abe's Exoddus. I still go back and play it from time to time. I remember reading over the game manual again and again for the story and to dream about getting the sweet merch. I've been a lover of the Oddworld games since Abe's Oddysee and will be one until the end of time. Those games really influenced my sense of humor and my obsession with world building.

Stranger's wrath had been my favorite. I love the inventive live ammo

My favourite is Abe‚Äôs Exoddus. I have such fond memories when I was 12.

I remember playing the demo from the discs you receive from the Playstation magazines, I loved it sooo much that I wished it for Christmas, my mum bought it for me!! I then binged that game to to end in a few days üòÇüòÇ

Sydney, Australia

I then re-bought all the games on steam. I love oddworld!!!

There are a lot of good games in the series, but Abe's Odyssey has a special place in my heart, as it was one of the first games I've played on my PC back when I was a kid in the 90s.

Europe

My favourite game is Munch's Odyssey. This was my first game for the original xbox what I bought with the system. I played it through like minimum 5 times. (It was funny when in the second playtrough I discovered that the thumbstick is clickable, and that is a kick in the game :D
Hungary

Abe's Oddysee was actually the first video game I ever played so it really has a special place in my heart. That being said i love all the games :)

North America

Oddworld has such a unique gameplay that is super fun! I enjoy the dark humor especially, I love it and have been a huge fan since it released on the PS1. My favorite game would have to be Munch's Oddysee he's just so cute, the little Fuzzels are too! ‚ô•Ô∏è I can't wait for the Soul Storm release.

I'm from North America üòä

Stranger‚Äôs Wrath has always been my favorite Oddworld Game and I still own my original copy on Xbox! I have replayed the game maybe 10 times, including on mobile, and me and my parents always waited for a sequel, and Sekto needs to be found!

Sekto‚Äôs dam has always been an inspiration for me as a creative writer. And I remember one of the biggest and most insane moments was seeing Sekto‚Äôs office at the VERY top of the dam, and of course the iconic ending of the series with the biggest plot twist ever . Much love from California and the United States. Birthplace of the Wild West :D

USA - California

Munch‚Äôs Oddysee, first one I played!

And USA :)

New N Tasty was the first Oddworld game I fully played through but I will always appreciate going back to the original (even if it's nail biting hard). Good luck to all!

Region: North America

Picking only one is hard to do. I love them all and just purchased Oddworld Munch Oddysee. To have them all on the same platform would be great. I am starting to really enjoy Stranger‚Äôs Wrath.
A retired widow in RGV Texas It's never too old to play!

I'd like to say I've played most of the oddworld games that are out, but that would be a lie lol I have played the crap outta Munch's oddysee! It was the very first game I played on the original Xbox and I played it getting all possible endings. I loved it so much that I even bought the PS3 Port of the game and finished that one as well. I would definitely love to get the system and experience strangers wrath myself, but if I don't win the console, I'd be more than happy to get Munch's oddysee on the switch and have another go around with that classic. -North America/ Lawton Oklahoma

I've never played one, but I'd like to get Stranger's Wrath soon!

Was obsessed with Abe's Oddysee as a kid, and loved replaying it in New 'n tasty. The world/mythos mixed with humor really grasped me, and I loved Elum and the chanting mechanic.
New York, USA

I have to go with the original Oddworld Abe's Odyssey. I learned to whistle by imitating Abe-speak.

I enjoyed Strangers Wrath back when it was first released. It\"s a very underrated game for its time.

North America

Loved strangers wrath as a kid! Still have fond memories of it's unique play style. Detroit Michigan here

Abe's Exoddus! USA

Stranger‚Äôs Wrath. Great story. Great characters. Loved the live ammo!

Probably the first one, OddWorld: Abe's Oddysee. I think Abe is a charismatic and memorable character. His voice and all the sounds in the games are a combination between cute and gross hahaha... But about the gameplay, I love the puzzles and how the plataforming part remind me Prince of Persia, Another World or Flashback.

Off topic but I've been checking out this site for a couple of years now, and I never seen a page with this many comments before. Guess giveaways does wonders lol.

Some of my earliest memories of gaming include playing around on Abe's Odyssey. I didn't know how to really play the game at the time because I was about 5, but it was always fun taking control of sligs!

Odd world: Strangers Wrath

North America!

Strangers wrath, north America. That console looks so nice!

I have to say Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty on the Wii U. It's a great game and it was the first time I played it on a Nintendo system. I think it was the first Oddworld game on a Nintendo system.

Europe.

Munchs oddysee was the first game I played, I was around 8 and I grew up playing more oddworld games. Im excited for soulstorm and I'm glad oddworld is still going strong. I'm in Oklahoma, in central North America

Abe's Oddysee for the PS1 is my favorite Oddworld game :3
Los Angeles, CA, USA

Munch's Oddysee was my favorite Oddworld game growing up, played it with my Dad a lot. It actually used to scare me as a kid! But it's left a lasting impression on me and I've played it several times over since then. Love the Oddworld games.

My favourit is \"Oddworld:Abe's Oddysee\", because that was the first and that was incredible when I was 11. But I like them all!
I live in US

I played the very first oddworld when I was a wee lass with my family on ps1! I have very strong memories sitting around the tv with my mom and brother taking turns trying to get past the sligs. The nostalgia is so strong that I could not imagine ever picking a different one in the series, even though they all have their place. I am in the united states.

I've played them all, but I got to say, the first one, Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee, on the PS1, back in 1997 when I was in college for computer animation. One of my very fondest gaming memories. It was ground breaking and inspiring, and it hooked me for everything Oddworld Inhabitants, henceforth. Texas, USA

The love all of the oddworld games! The art is amazing & the humor is fantastic. Oddworld is what really got me into gaming. If I had choose a favorite I would say abe's exodus. It is a fun expansion into abes character. From the US.

I really enjoyed Oddworld Abes Exodus. Abes Odyssey was great as well but I think Exodus just improved on what was already great and added a lot of new puzzles and mechanics. Arizona North America! 'Murica!

My favourite would be exoddus. I do a run through at least once a year.
Can't wait for soulstorm!

Australia.

I bought the original Xbox for Munch's Odyssey. It was my gateway to Oddworld and will always be my favorite.

Stranger's Wrath is my favorite game in the series. While I enjoyed watching my buddies play through the earlier oddworld games in the series, Stranger's Wrath was the first time I remember actually enjoying playing the game by myself.
N.A. region

I really enjoyed Oddworld Adventures on my Gameboy, the game was bizarre, kind of reminded me of Donkey Kong Country SNES Graphics wise. I had fun even if I was young and silly and had no clue how to finish the games, Bats of doom and exploding landmines...ouch

USA, North Carolina!

Munch's Odyssey was the first game I brought home with the original Xbox. I've been following and hooked on the series ever since.

North America Austin Texas

Id have to say the first one i ever played as a kid is my favorite due to the memories. It was Oddworld Abes oddysee for the PlayStation. North america, michigan

Abe's Odyssey but I've seen tons of strangers wrath and interested in giving it a whirl one day. North america

Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee I remember being a great time.

The first game I ever played was Oddworld Abe's Oddysee, It was a big part of my childhood and I still play it to this day!

New England here! ^^

Strangers Wrath is the most interesting one to me. The style and game mechanics are inventive/refreshing

NA here üôÇ

Me and my brothers used to have so much fun playing Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus. I'm in North America.

Abe‚Äôs Odyssey has to be my favorite of all time. It was the game that started my love for the series and the world that was created. Everything about was just beautiful and it was my go to game growing up!!

Jackson, Mississippi, USA

My favorite is the original, Abe's oddysee. That's my earliest memories and some of the most unforgettable with the playstation 1. Thank you for such a great childhood Lorne! American Region.

I have played them all my absolute favourite franchise even remember this game getting released back in the day on the old xbox, I'm getting my son into the oddworld games he loves Abe and munch but hasn't gotten to 'the stranger 'yet.....
We are from the UK/EUROPE /CUMBRIA would be amazing and i would love to freak out my kids friends when the see it

I played the original over and over on my PS1. Mostly due to the lack of a memory card. Still my favorite. North America.

I really enjoyed Abes Odyssey. I enjoyed the character Abe so much, I had to get him tattooed on my leg. USA/PA.

My favorite old-world game by far is Strangers wrath. Its a great story and I had fun playing it! Good luck to everyone who entered this is really awesome for them to do!!

USA

NAE pennsylvania. My favorite oddworld game would Abe's: Exoddus. I was introduced to oddworld at like 4 or 5 years old by my dad on the ps2. I have played all odworld games now except for munch and strangers. Im a huge fan of oddworld and it would be crazy to w8n this and get to play and show my dad this awesome console. Much love. Im excited for soulstorm and i hope you guys remake munchs someday! Goodluck

Love stranger's wrath and the unique
mix of adventure and FPS. I played on original Xbox.
USA

I grew up with the GBA Munch‚Äôs Oddysee, so it‚Äôs always been a sort of guilty pleasure for me despite all the other games being objectively better!

I‚Äôm from the USA!

I remember first seeing Abe's Oddysee when I was about 4-5 years old and being completely spellbound by that opening cutscene. So I've been a huge fan ever since.

I love all the Oddworld games but nostalgia there has them all beat -Oddysee gets the spot as my favorite.

Thanks for doing this giveaway! üòµ

US, North America

Strangers wrath is my favorite. I remember renting it and being so intrigued that I stayed up playing through it all night.

North America. Nebraska

My grandmother found a copy of Abe's Odysee in a parking lot. It didn't have the disc but we loved the art so much that we tracked down the actual game and she would love to watch me play it. I was terrible but she didn't care, she loved to watch me talk to the mudokons.

Anyway, I love Abe's Odysee. Always have always will

I am in North America and love the classic Abe‚Äôs Oddessey!

I've only ever played the Original Abe's Oddysee so that will have to be my favourite Oddworld game. Actually... The Abe's Oddysee demo on the Demo1 disc is the only one I have played lol. Do you know how many times I have beaten that demo, I couldn't count them because I was too young to remember them all. Used to play it and get scared at the intro and the sligs. Loved it, we also kept mimicking Abe's voice with \"Get Me Out of here\" and his farts. Brings back memories just saying this.

Region: Australia

The original oddworld is my fave.

North america

My favourite will always be Abe‚Äôs Oddysee. Not long after it came out, my parents set me up with my uncles PS and his copy of Oddysee for a few hours while they had a party. I didn‚Äôt get far, but when you‚Äôre a kid, nothing‚Äôs funnier than farts üòÇ

Down in Australia for me

My favorite oddworld game is definitely Abe's Oddysee for PS1!

I've enjoyed all the games in the series, but the one that made me
laught the most was in Abe's Exoddus, where you would fart after
drinking a potion that gave you volatile gas, then possess that fart to
position it to set off a great explosion to disarm traps or clear out a
room of sligs! Young me couldn't stop laughing at that game mechanic!

Fond memories from Down Under, Australia!

Ive loved all the games in the series to varying degrees but Strangers Wrath was a game changer and by far my favorite. (North America)

I've played the Oddworld games alot when I was younger but my favorite has still gotta be either Strangers wrath or Munch's Munch's oddysee they were the ones I put the most time into
- I'm in the USA‚ù§

We loved playing Stranger's Wrath as a family! Thank you for doing this! We are in North America.

I haven't played any Oddworld games but the series always looked interesting to get into and recommended by my friends. I would totally love this to be my dive into the universe even if it meant providing a 5 page in depth review after finishing the game, haha. I'm United States üëç

Abe's Oddysey. I remember first playing it on PC. I was a kid at the time. Spent hours upon hours playing that game. My dad and I shared a save file, and we'd watch each other play and help each other out when solving puzzles. Very fond memories.

Hey! I'm in North America! My favorite game was always Munch's Odyssey. I grew up playing this as a kiddo!

I remember renting Stranger's Wrath from Hollywood Video over a decade ago. It was and is one of my favorite games. Still waiting for a sequel.

I live in North America.

Strangers wrath, easily one of my favorite games of all time. Me, my brother and my dad used to play it all the time when i was younger, it really helped us bond. region: North america

Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee was and might just still be my
favorite game. Hence why I couldn't help but get New 'N Tasty when it was on Limited Run! Such a unique universe with a lot of things to say commentary-wise. Oddworld Inhabitants and all involved knocking it out the park with this switch design for sure!
(Oh. And I'm in the United States.)

Always loved the original on ps1. Fond memories of playing that one with my cousin. USA, Michigan.

I've loved all the games but Munch's Odyssey is one I remember best c: so I guess it can be my favorite.

Odd world: abe's odyssey I live in north america.

Hello,

My all time favorite game happens to be an Oddworld game, that game is Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee. It was one of my first PlayStation games and I to this day have only beaten it once. It's my Dark Souls.

My favorite Oddworld game is a tie between Strangers Wrath and Munch's Odyssey.
I have never played a game series where the setting and worldbuilding has captivated me as much as Oddworld. Growing up, I used to spend early mornings making sure no Mudokens or Fuzzles perished during my romp through Mudos and its various industrial zones. It really opened my eyes to the entire puzzle platformer genre and what storytelling in videogames COULD be. When I was a bit older, my Father bought Strangers Wrath and Him and I both would spend countless hours playing it. I remember racing to catch up to where he was on his file during my own play-through and him dropping hints about what would happen next with both of us gushing about the story and the world together. I ended up beating that game like 15 times and every single playthrough the magic still shines through. I highly doubt I will ever get tired of these games and one day when I have children of my own, they too will experience these games. Thank you for making masterpieces!
I'm in the United States region.

Abe's odyssey was my favorite, i love that game, still play it. North America is my region.

I love both Abes Oddysee and Abes Exoddus on the original Playstation. Spent soooooooo many hours on them!!!!!!!
From Tauranga, New Zealand

The og Oddworld: Abe's Oddyssey will always be my favorite. Lots of good memories of playing that game as a kid with my dad.

North America here.

Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus. Is my all time fave, cant go wrong with oddworld :-) - Australia

Strangers wrath is the only one I haven't played, I'm a massive oddworld fan, even having played all the Gameboy versions (which work great btw) and have to say my absolute favourite was the first oddworld adventures on gameboy

I loved playing New 'n' tasty, re-living some of my earlier gaming memories playing Abe's Oddysee but with beautiful new graphics.

Australia,

Have to go with Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee. Too much nostalgia for any of the other games to overcome!

My favorite was Strangers Wrath! I loved getting the 1st and 3rd person perspective! My next favorite would be New N Tasty!

Denver, CO USA

My favourite would have to be Abe's Oddysee. It was the first game of the series that I played and I loved the shit out of it. While I technically played Exoddus more, it loses points because towards the end I made a jump that hit 2 screen transitions going down (I think you were meant to climb down like a staircase, but I missed the edges by a few pixels) and before hitting the ground the game quicksaved. I would die, respawn, die, respawn, on and on for eternity. There wasn't anything more hilariously heartbreaking to young me.

The first two Oddworld games are some of my favorite games ever, but Strangers Wrath is close behind.
United States

Oddworld Abe's exodus is my favorite by far. Spent most of my childhood playing this game over and over again and drawing Abe in every notebook I have.

United States , Louisiana here.

Pick me!

I'm writing from the US, but there's a catch: I'm actually time traveling back to this moment just to write this comment. You see, my favorite Oddworld is this very one! I play it on this hairy, Chewbacca-looking console (signed by Mr. Lanning!) that I won back in July, 2020.

It's possible that if I don't win this console (again), it may begin to disappear from existence (much like Marty McFly's family slowly did in that picture in Back To The Future).

Good to see you all again (and by \"you\" I'm referring to the world in 2020). Oh my gosh what a year!

If I win, I'll tell you how this whole Covid thing turned out.

Peace!

Abe's Odyssey was my obsession as a kid, I loved possessing the slogs! I loved making them beat their own people Haha. My favorite level was the scrab stockyard, it gives me anxiety just thinking about it. I'm in north America and I would love this switch! I would also love to see Abe in smash bros!

my favorite is definitely strangers wrath I love the story and the gameplay mechanics the most, But i def love all of the games sooo much California Usa

The OG Abe's Odyssey is my absolute favorite! My friend and I rented it (remember rental stores!?) soooo many times to finish it. I think we got the perfect ending too! Great memories! I live in California USA. Good luck everyone! :D

Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee. It was the first PC gaming experience I had and the imagery has always stuck with me since. Making it a crucial part of what got me so into video games.
Pennsylvania, USA

Abe‚Äôs Odyssey!!! I played it all the time as a child and ended up wearing out the disk from use. Still like to replay every once in awhile along with the others in the series. ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è

USA/Wyoming

My first and favourite game is \"Oddworld : Abe's Exoddus\". I played it a lot of times saving always all 300 mudokons of the game.

I'm from Europe.

I've played through every oddworld game to date and was even looking forward to the never released Hand of Odd which I'm still hopefull for üòâ have to say though for my favourite it was a close tie between abes Exodus and strangers wrath. Absolutely loves the continuation from oddysey into exodus and the new slig forms and being able to chant into paramites and scrabs and strangers wrath was a completely different experience and executed perfectly.

New Zealand üòÅ

My favorite oddworld game will always be strangers wrath for being the most unique oddworld game and probably the most fun in my opinion
North America

Munch's Odyssey is my favorite because I just have so many memories of me and my old childhood friends all chilling in my room and playing some of the same levels on repeat and see who could take out more enemies, or save me people, or just the fastest time. I miss those days.. Those people. But Munch is hands down the best for me haha

U.S.A here :D

My first video game was Abe‚Äôs Oddysee on the PSX, but grew to find my favorite game to be Exoddus. I finally beat Munch last year and I finally started Stranger‚Äôs. I‚Äôve been New N Tasty numerous times and love all the games to this day. No one around me know what Oddworld was, but I always tell them that Oddworld is my reason for gaming!

United States!

As much as I love Stranger's Wrath (and I do), my favorite has to be Abe's Exoddus. Not only was it my first foray into Oddworld, but it's got a certain kind of dark, grungy atmosphere that you could really only get in a '90s game.

(US)

I've played every Oddworld game and still continue to shuffle between Munch's Oddesy and Strangers wrath. I love the wide open worlds and the thought needed to complete certain tasks. But I'll never forget the time my mom bought me Abs Oddesy from Costco; because from there I was hooked to all the Oddworld inhabitants and their backstories.

North America, Albuquerque NM.

U.S. HERE! I am absolutely in LOVE with the first Oddworld: Abe‚Äôs Oddysee! I play this regularly still on my PS1. It truly does mean the (odd)world to me!

Oddworld: Abe's exoddus!

No

For me munchs oddessy which is what got me into this amazingly underrated series

Europe

My favorite Oddworld Game is Abe‚Äôs Odyssey! I‚Äôm in North America

Stranger's Wrath is my favorite Oddworld game by far, especially because it was made when Oddworld was still based in my hometown.
California

The only oddworlds that ive played is the origional one and odd world: munches odyssey. Ive also played new and tastey, but id have to say by far the one I love the most is odd world: abes odyssey. It might also be because its the main one I grew up with lol

Oddworld is my favorite series. I have never been able to figure out why. Stranger‚Äôs Wrath is the gotcha game for me...Canada region.

My favorite is Abe‚Äôs Oddysee. I still remember being blown away by the beautiful cg cutscenes and amazing atmosphere. Never played anything like it before. North American region, good luck all!

Stranger's Wrath is great fun, as a result of switching up the Oddworld gameplay style! :)

North America.

Though I love Strangers Wrath and Abe's Oddysee, I have to choose Munch's Oddysee as my favorite Oddworld game. That game blew my mind as a kid, and was one of the first games I owned. I have a lot of good memories playing it with my dad on xbox, taking turns. I loved the sense of humor and the characters. The creativity of the whole world really intrigued me, and is part of what made me fall in love with and want to create \"odd\" creature/concept art of my own. I can't wait to play Soulstorm, and I'd love to be able to play Oddworld games on switch! (I'm in North America)

I'll forever love Oddworld New n' Tasty. I really enjoyed the art style for that title. In reality the only title I played from the series. The speed running community for this game is insane. I'm from the USA.

Oddworld: Munch‚Äôs Oddysee for me. NTSC Americas region

I have loved these games since Odyssey came out. I love the messages of these games, I love the universe and the creature design. I have picked them up on PC, Switch, and the original xbox/PS1. Oddworld is incredible and this is one beautiful system. Thanks for the chance to win it!

I love Oddworld: Abes Odyssey it's been one of my favorites since I was in high school. In in North America

Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath is one of my all-time favorite games! It had a huge impact on me when I was younger as I was really into western movies and just had a generally eclectic taste in things, so the aesthetic and atmosphere was perfect for me!
I'm in the US of A.

Gotta go with Abe's Exoddus. I received Abe's Oddysee as a Christmas present in 1997 for the Playstation, and fell in love with game and its universe. There was nothing like it at the time (or anything like it still), so when I beat it (including saving all the Mudokons) I wanted more.

Low and behold, to my amazement, a sequel was announced for the following year. Abe's Exoddus Csme out just in time for the holidays and, yes, I got it for Christmas and 12-year old me was blown away even further than before. I can see it didn't look any different from Oddysee, but I didn't care. That think 2-disc case and expanded world had me. One of the lines I still say to my self today (and my father actually because he saw me playing it and thought it was funny as hell), and that line is, \"No bones, no brew! I am totally screwed!!!!\". That game just did everything for me. I even bought so.e of the posters from the internet at the time because I loved Exoddus that much.

So while Munch's Oddysee and Stranger's Wrath were excellent games that I too love and acknowledge, I still consider Abe's Exoddus to be my favorite Oddworld game (thus far). So seeing it get a complete remake into Soulstorm is utterly exciting and I am waiting patiently until it finally comes out.

So if I can win this gorgeous Fuzzle edition of the Switch, I'm honestly not sure I'll play it. I really want to put it on a shelf and admire it. It's a nice dream, but I doubt I'd win it out considering the chances.

US Residence

I've played the Oddworld series since I was a kid, It's hard to pick a favorite. But I think Abe's Exoddus has the best. It had a the best environmental progression, and was very scenic. Especially for a game of its time. Truly a treasure.

USA - WA

Hi there y'all, I'm Dalton, I'm from Florida, and I'm 18 years old. I just wanted to say good luck to everyone. I grew up playing Munches Odyssey on an origonal Xbox, and would still probably be playing it now if my Xbox wasnt destroyed. That's the only time I was ever able to enjoy the incredibly captivating world of Odd world and i would really love the chance to experience it once again. Thank you all and again good luck to everyone.

Pretty funny seeing people who don't really comment on this site now doing so because of that s3xy Switch.

My favourite odd world game is the original Abes Odyssey I remember the demo disc being played to death when I got it and then finally getting to play the whole experience , it was like nothing we had seen before - ability to control enemies, speak to friends and the deep varied backgrounds... simply fantastic. Also new and tasty is pretty good but nostalgia wise the original for me wins every time- follow me ok

UK (Scotland) here so EU region üòÄ

I never had a PlayStation growing up so I didn‚Äôt get into Abe‚Äôs Oddworld until much later. That being said, Oddworld: Stranger‚Äôs Wrath was my favorite Xbox game let alone Oddworld game. Can‚Äôt wait for Soulstorm!

North America. Saginaw, MI.

Stranger's Wrath is my favourite by far, such a creative and unique experience. USA!

Wow! I remember the excitement I had when first playing Abe's Oddyee on the playstation. At the time it was a friends playstation and game but as soon as I saved enough money, I bought it but I didn't have a playstation that could play it until I received my very own playstation. Years later I let a friend borrow it and it was \"stolen\". I worked my butt off trying to buy the game. I was hurt beyond belief. Lol I know it's a game but goodness at least buy me another one.

First Oddworld game I've played was Abe's Oddysee.
North America region

Munch's Oddyssey is my favorite in the series. Even though I love all of them, there's a kind of ambience and atmosphere that I get from that game that makes it something really special. The soundtrack, for instance, is a perfect way to unwind and relax. The gentle droning echoes and wind while you look out from a barren cliff in the spooceshrub forest, high above the clouds, is something unforgettable!

USA

My region is United States. I have to say my favorite would be Strangers Wrath as it's the first one I played and has lots of personality, but the recently announced Oddworld game looks to be a contender for my new favorite.

Good luck everyone!!!

I have not played Odd World, but man that Switch looks Odd! It would be awesome to play something new. I have seen the game before, but honestly not much more then articles. I am in the USA, if that needs to be said. Happy Birthday!

Munch‚Äôs Odyssey was my first Oddworld game and still remains my favorite next to Strangers Wrath. The open world that you could explore as Abe and Munch just really made the story so much more enjoyable for me. I still play New ‚ÄòN Tasty to this day. Oddworld will always be a second home to me

USA

My favourite was Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus back in the day. Loved it as a kid playing it for the first time and letting friends play around the TV.

England / Europe

Abe's Oddysee. It was my favourite game on PS1.

Can't decide if Abe's Oddysee or Abe's Exodus but i think i prefer Oddysee.
Never played Stranger's Wrath though :/

(USA)
My first time playing Oddworld games was When I was a little kid at my uncles apartment. I remember putting Munch's Oddysee in the classic Xbox and being taken away to a new world of wonder. As I grew up in life taking on many hobbies, the art/concept of Oddworld had an impact on my art, and way of life. I hold these games close to my heart, and am ever grateful for their impact on my life and precious memories. ‚ú®üí´‚ú® Munch's Oddysee became more than just a game, it became a part of me. I still play it on classic xbox to this day, I can't wait to experience the other worlds created by these artists/developers some day.

My favorite oddworld game would be abe's odyssey because I loved the dark tone and it's the game that made me wanna become a game designer

I remember my first odd world game
Abe‚Äôs odyssey for the ps1, back when my father was a into gaming. Me and him would stay up late every night even on school nights trying to beat the hardest parts to get through the game. He doesn‚Äôt play like he used to which Is kinda heartbreaking but every time a remaster of odd world or new installment of a odd world game is rumored to come out I still remember the good times I shared with him all those years ago and I can‚Äôt wait for the release of Abe‚Äôs odyssey: soul storm.

My favorite Oddworld game was Exodus, I played it when I was very young and a lot of the environmentally conscious elements went over my head. I remember feeling a deep sense of mystery and weirdness about the world that kept me coming back to it over many years.

The paramites were my favorite of the creatures and I remember playing through those levels ad nauseam with the use of cheatcodes.

As I grew older I started to see the series through a new lens and now I just have a deep seated respect for the intention behind the games and a love for the unapologetic creativity it took to create those worlds. I'm so excited the team has stayed together and is now reintroducing an entirely new generation to the Oddities that were started some twenty years ago. Many thanks for the years of inspiration and wonder!

Munch's Oddysee. I don't think my parents knew what they were getting me into. The opening cinematic had me hooked and seeing the world instantly in new light; with more a tie to social consciousness.

I remember Odyssey and Exodus. I was a kid and being abled to fart in game and possess the fart as an ability was awesome.

NA here

I've been a die-hard fan since day one, and Abe's Oddysee is still my all time favorite game.

May the ODDS be ever in my favor!

I discovered Oddworld with Abe's Exodus and instantly fell in love, it was just the right kind of weird for me. That being said, Stranger's Wrath is not only my favorite of the series but one of my all-time favorite games. It's not often that concept, storyline, and gameplay are all excellent but this game hit all three out of the park. Thank you so much for making that game!

Abes Exoddus by far because of the story and how much strategy went into it. Also because it was a staple of my childhood

I really like Munch‚Äôs Oddysee! It‚Äôs underrated in my opinion. My region is the United States.

Munches oddysey is my favorite. remember playing it around Christmas break. Beat it once. Then went through saving all the fuzzels. The went through killing them all.

OddWorld: Munch's Odyssee is an under appreciated masterpiece. With wonderfully designed characters, an awesome soundtrack, hilarious and strong story, strategy, action, it is a game beyond compare. And still have it on my Steam account !!
North America region/ Canada

I grew up playing oddworld, and they always were my favorite games. I was so excited when Munch‚Äôs Oddysee came out and immediately fell in love with it. I was a little skeptical of Strangers Wrath at first, but after playing it, it soon became one of, if not my most, favorite of the games in the series.

My favorite Oddworld game is still the original Abe's Odysee that I got when I was 8 or 9. I was really amazed by the strange world that the game took place in.

United States

(North America) I won‚Äôt give a super long sap story but if I do win I‚Äôm gonna give the console to my brother who has been waiting so long for Oddworld to expand into switch and into more games, we both love the games but he is far more deserving than me! I have great memories of watching him play Strangers Wrath, which is our favorite. Thank you regardless.

My favorite was Munchs oddysee , it was one of the first games I ever bought as a kid on my first console, original Xbox. I‚Äôm from California, USA!

Abe's Oddysee was the first Oddworld game I played and remains one of my favorites (Exoddus being a very close second). I was 7 when I received Oddysee in a trade with a gamer kid who lived in the neighborhood. I didn't get passed the first section of the game due to my absolute fear of sligs. I never played again after that. Fast forward to my early teen years and I rediscovered Oddysee in an old box in the garage from a recent move. A rush of excitement and familiarity came all at once upon finding this lost gem. I was old enough at the time to appreciate the rich, beautiful, and dark storytelling and had quickly become captivated by Abe's story. I understood the deeper messages portrayed in the game and it sparked the need to see more of Oddworld. I have since played every game and am looking forward to Soulstorm as well. Thanks to anyone who has read this far into a snippet of my childhood nostalgia. These games hold a special place in my heart.
P.S. My birthday is on July 18th too!

I played all of the Abe's games growing up! They were an essential part of my childhood. Strangers wrath was a bit different but it was flawless! A new twist on an old favorite! So excited for the new game coming out, I'm absolutely thrilled!

Love the entire series but my favorite probably has to be Stranger's Wrath. The Abe games are amazing too, but Stranger's Wrath is such a short but densely packed game that feels really grand and epic. The gameplay is wholly unique to the series, and the broad scope of FPS games by combining stealth, platforming, third and first person gameplay. I really don't feel like there's another game that's quite like this one. Stranger's Wrath rules!!

USA

My first and favorite experience was the fantastic Oddworld Abe's Oddysee on PC the graphics blew me away at the time and it had a game play reminiscent of Flashback another all time great. United States.

I would have to say New 'n' Tasty, mainly because I guess I first played it on PS1 back in the day and it was tough as hell LOL

Europe here :)

Munch's Oddysee is great. My niece would constantly ask for help from me and was genuinely interested to continue playing it and so was I.
North America

My favorite Oddworld game so far is Oddworld Abe's Odyssey/New 'n' Tasty Iam from Europe, Germany. Cant wait for Oddworld: Soulstorm, i think this will be my next fave Oddworld game :)

I love the Munchs Odysee's cutscene when Abe and the little fuzzballs attack the Molluck in the lab, (US)

Definitely Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus! Has always stuck with me with very fond memories of it. I really should have my son give it a try now that I think of it! Wisconsin, USA

Oddworld Munch's Oddysee was always my favorite. It was also the first I played on the original Xbox as a kid. I've played them all since that and loved them. I've been looking forward to a new entry in the pentalogy for a long time.
Region: North America

My favorite Oddworld game is always changing, but I've found myself coming back to Stranger's Wrath the most in recent years. I love how it still feels so great to play despite being so different from the previous games, and I just love all the characters so much.

USA

Oh man! Stranger's Wrath was one of my very first video games ever! I got an xbox with Halo 2 thanks to my cousin introducing me to gaming. I also grew up watching the G4 channel to check out what was new in gaming. An episode of X-Play reviewed Stranger's Wrath, and I KNEW I had to play! I always found myself renting games from my local Hollywood Video (now gone :[) based off of those reviews, but one game kept finding it's way into my Xbox. I put so many hours into Stranger's Wrath as a kid. I was the only one who played in my household, so a solo adventure with BADASS gameplay with hilarious humor blew my childhood mind away. I loved its music, style, and characters and this game cemented my taste in games with rock solid gameplay and narratives. I ended up finally saving enough money to get a used copy of Stranger's Wrath from EB Games, that still sits in my cabinet to this day. I owe my gaming career now to those very games that got me into my Xbox. Halo 2 and Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath.

USA resident

Have my original pal ps1 oddworlds that cannot be beaten and the downloads for Xb1X and ps4 pro

Ever since the demo disc for ps1 came out in the Australian magazine ive loved this game the graphics and the gameplay and the way it goes about using the ps1 beyond its intended capabilities was genius

I've played all of the oddworld games released so far. While I love all of them Strangers wrath has to be my favorite. So creative and fun. Still incredibly bummed about the cancellation of The Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot. Very much looking forward to soulstorm, though. Would love to have the custom Nintendo Switch.
North America

Strangers Wrath will probably always be my absolute favorite just for all the find memories of playing it with my parents when I was younger, and then again recently! (North America, Arizona)

I grew up playing exoddus and oddysee on the ps1 and to this day they are my favorite games. The art style is absolutely unrivaled in games today, its so unique and intricate and beautiful. And the story lines really said something meaningful and spoke to me even as a 6 year old lol. That idea that we‚Äôre all in a way enslaved by the powerful and all it takes is one individual thinking differently to set something in motion. And also that there is something more and meaningful out there, i think these games speak to these basic human desires in a profound way. Also I loved the dialog mechanics in the game and insane attention to detail (farting at sligs, ect.). Ive played through these games at least 50 times. Never did play munches oddysee or strangers wrath because it hurt me too much to see that beautiful 2d art style go away lol. And i liked new and tasty but i couldnt get used to the mechanics, the old oddworlds were done in blocks (i.e. one step forward was one block) and without that metric my mathematical brain struggles. Anyway im from north america. And nintendo switch or not, you should port the originals to ps4/ps5 üíñ also, so fricken jacked for soulstorm, you sweet geniuses.

Can‚Äôt beat the original Abes Oddysee on PS1 that‚Äôs by far my favourite :D huge part of my childhood! Played it with my dad as a kid.

Region: Europe

I remember this game, I have a lot of fun in an adventure on a different planet with creatures that want to eat my blood brothers, I and Abe will confront the Glukkons and save the residents of Oddworld, I would love to win the Nintendo Switch and live this adventure so exciting.

The quality of this game will be incredible on Nintendo Switch

USA

The Strangers Wrath was my favourite out all them, it was dark funny weird, I love the Live ammo in it and we all can agree the fuzzys was the worse in the best way ever üòÇ it's a shame that there was not a sequel. I'm still gutted it has not appeared on Xbox One yet

Calling from UK England, Essex

My favorite is Stranger's Wrath from a gameplay perspective, but on an emotional level the original will always be my favorite. When I was a kid, one of my older cousins had a dope basement bedroom and he would always let me come over and he'd show me video games I wasn't allowed to play since I was young lol. He introduced me to Dino Crisis and Resident Evil.

We'd also play other games though, like Eggs of Steel and Heart of Darkness. One day he introduced me to the very first Oddworld and I was hooked; I'd never seen or played anything like it before.

My ma bought oddworld for my ps1 and munch for xbox. Great games

It is hard to say which one is my favorite since the entire series of games have a special place in my heart, but Abe's Exoddus has a to be on the top, the mechanics where very enjoyable for a game that was made so quickly and the story was very engrossing!

North America

Oddworld: Munch‚Äôs Oddysee!!! I was absolutely glued to the Xbox controller when it came out originally. Still play it on the VITA as well.

Has to be Abe's Odyssey. While a little clunky, it felt like the next step moving from the previous era. Europe.

Munches oddysee and strangers wrath are my favorites because I played both of them when I was real young the oddworld series is the only reason I can't spell oddysee correctly.

Actually i like all the Games but there are 2 unusual ones i really like despite everyone hating them and these are Oddworld Adventure 1 and 2 for the Gameboy System, especially Oddworld Adventure 2 which is to this day my absolute favourite because its just so bizarre (you could also say so odd) seeing Oddworld, especially Exoddus, being ported to the Gameboy,

Big Greetings From Europe/Germany!

Stranger's Wrath obviously the best by far! One of the most unique games of it's time and the great story really hooked me as a kid!

Reigon: North America

Oddworld Abe's Oddysee
Region: United States
I don't know if I'm really supposed to pitch how much I loved this game, but maybe the creators would be amused lol
This game was so thrilling and odd. I was an odd kid, but it was one of the few games even though it wasn't two player that I could be playing with my sister that I had because the trade off was just built in. I like that O.G. Mario Bros style.
It was shocking and amazing that how well you handled your people affected the ending. I thought it was innovative back then and was thrilled to see it get remastered as New N' Tasty, but I haven't played through that one yet.
So the unforgettable story in my childhood that I still tell every now and again to this day. Is the moment I had saved in a spot that looked like certain death. My older sister was pissed at me and if I didn't save us we'd likely never play again. I think the scene was I was on a lower platform I had to maneuver around a mine or some obstacle, but I had to do it faster than a slig could shoot me and if I got to the other side I could get on the upper platform and be safe from that, but there was a slag up there too and a ledge to the left. If I hadn't have saved where I had I might have been able to possess the slig and handle it a whole other way.
I succeeded in the way that you might imagine. I loved that the game let you make your own mistakes and there wasn't just one way to do things and you didn't have to play it safe. To this day I love that it made a difference in your result and I have raved about this game for all my life.
I'm sure a bunch of people have long winded stories about this game, it was fantastic, but thank you. Sometimes in my time it sucked being odd, it sucked being a girl gamer and it was so fun to be an odd alien lol Thank you thank you thank you

My favorite was Munch‚Äôs Odyssey! Not only did it add a bit to Abe‚Äôs story, but it brought an amazing character with it! It was a tough decision between Munch and Strangers Wrath though....
10/10 would play again.

Munch‚Äôs odyssey because he felt like even more of an underdog. NYC here.

I remember playing strangers wrath when I was a kid and having a blast playing it

I have always loved strangers wrath I used to play it on the original Xbox
Illinois/ us

UK and 'Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee' was my favourite
Unfortunately I never managed to keep hold of a copy to introduce my son to.

Strangers Wrath is my all time favorite! From North America here!

Munch's Oddysee was a really fun game that really expanded on the Oddworld's world and lore. I hope they try to experiment more with some 3D platforming in the future!

Region: North America

I started with Abe's Exoddus, so that'll be the favourite one for me.

United States here

It's really hard to choose a favorite but I have to go with Abe's Oddysee. It was the first PlayStation game I purchased for myself after have renting it so many times. I still remember the first time saving all of the Mudokons. I still consider it one of my greatest achievements. I live in North America.

Strangers wrath has to be my favorite! North America

Stranger's Wrath was always my favorite, such a unique game.

USA

I absolutely love all of the oddworld games. I've been a fan since I was about 2 years old. My father use to play Abe's oddysee and exodus on the PC and I would always stand behind him and watch. They would always laugh when I would chant with Abe while I ran around in my diapers. I've beaten every game since then and I absolutely can't wait until soulstorm releases. If I had to choose a favorite though, it would be strangers wrath. I played that game like crazy when it first came out. I must have beaten it like 50 times. I was so fascinated that you could switch between 1st and 3rd person to play it. Hopefully soon I might get a tattoo of the stranger!

North America

I don't even know what my favorite Odd-world game would be., but I think I am looking forward to the new game, Oddworld: Soulstorm, coming out this year in 2020.

I'm in the USA. Thanks for hosting this giveaway.

Munch's Oddysee is my favorite! I've played it dozens of times. My grandmother used to love watching me play it.

Been playing Oddworld games since I was 6 years old. From the moment I saw the opening intro. In the first game I KNEW I was going to be hooked for a very long time. I'm 27 now, and I still play Oddworld games. I love them all, the message they sent, feeling empathy toward Abe and wanting him to succeed. There has never been any other game that has managed to basically give me a heart attack (figuratively speaking) one moment to then fill me with a huge sense of accomplishment (and relief) the next. As for my favorite Oddworld game it would have to be Oddworld Abes Exoddus, there is just something magical about being able to posses your own farts and blowing up Sligs with them.....Its just perfect!

(North America/United States/ Pennsylvania)

Abe's Odyssey basically what inspired me to become an artist. Everything about that creepy funny world shaped me into who I am today (including the farts). Levi Neff from United States, Illinois.

Munch's Oddyssee has to be my favorite. I was thrilled (and lucky) as a kid to receive an original Xbox as a gift in Christmas 2001 alongside Munch's Oddyssee. The unique world, themes, characters, and humorous tone of this game stand out today in my mind from countless games I've played before and since 2001. I really hope these games find a wider audience and look forward to anything Oddworld Inhabitants puts out.

p.s. I also loved Stranger's Wrath and would love to see a continuation/spin off of that story.

Region: North America

I have enjoyed all of the oddworld games. I would have to say abe's odyssey would be the best one by far due to my dad watching me play and copying everything abe said. He still makes the farting noise and laughs afterwards just like Abe. I cant wait till soul soulstorm comes out. I just started playing strangers wrath and it is a really fun game and really enjoying it. I am in the United States.

Love the abe games, new ‚Äòn‚Äô tasty probably my favourite but have got to play stranger again haven‚Äôt played it since the original xbox
Uk/Europe

Favorite would be Abe's Oddysee/new n tasty. Such a great series very excited for what's to come. US/North America region.

My favorite Oddword game has to be the original game from 1997. I played all of the Oddworld games, and I liked seeing how all of them evolved with better graphics, etc., over the last 13 years.

I'm in the USA. Thanks for this giveaway.

My favorite is definitely Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus. This game means the world to me. United States here!

Strangers Wrath has been my favorite oddworld game since release. But I also loved new and tasty.
United States

REGION: North America - U.S.A.

Absolutely the OG one and only; Abe‚Äôs odyssey. The humor, the design, the storyline.. everything was absolutely spot on! I spent hours playing and replaying that game, I‚Äôve rebought it for every different console release, as well as Abe‚Äôs Exoddus (close second) , munch‚Äôs Odyssey (close third), and strangers wrath (close fourth, I loved the bounty system and critter ammo.. I‚Äôm just not as in to shooters as platform/puzzler! Still, such an original and inventive game!).

Pull My Finger.

I live in delaware .
First game I ever played as a child was munches oddysee I love that game so much. I remember having my dad complete the levels that were too difficult for me . üòç

Stranger's Wrath, I had a lot of fun with it on the Vita!
Europe

Honestly Oddworld Stranger's Wrath has been one my favorite games ever created! It taught me many things and mainly that I can have so much fun on my own.

I'm from USA, in the island of Puerto Rico üòã

Started playing Abe‚Äôs Exodus on the original PlayStation and it has been one of my favorite games since then and got me into video games
North America Region

NA - Abes Odyssey!

Oddworld Abes Oddysee. left itself in history books back in 1997. Literally the game that set the mark of precisional tactical gameplay. Playstation came with the demo disc 1 and that game which you all went to was the abes oddysee demo. The humor yet difficult gameplay was incomparable and still challenges new gamers to this very day. Thats why it was the best because it started this whole franchise of 'lets save them all' with that voice at the back of your head also saying 'good luck on that one' and an unexplainable amount of times making the fart noise to catch the sligs attention before taking over its mind. !!Textbook!!
UK ENGLAND

my favorite oddworld game is oddworld exodus as in my heart it is a perfect sequel and was extraordinarily fun to play.( North America )

Oddworld: Abe‚Äôs Oddysee is my favourite. Loved it from start to finish. The tone and the puzzles were great.

Hi from Europe :)

Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus
But strangers wrath was my jam on Xbox
Switch is my go to right now I haven't been on my Xbox or PS4, this would be so sweet to win üëèüèº

America

Strangers Wrath is by far my favorite game. Since I was a bit young when the games started gaining traction, I always watched my brother play since it‚Äôs also his favorite. If I do win, I‚Äôll give the
console to him. (North America)

Oddworld Munch's Odyssey would have to edge being my favorite game. Being able to play each level differently, and having soooo much replayability really put this game over the top.

Having an amazing cast of characters, the plethora of stages, and funny dialog was icing on the cake.

Stranger's Wrath is a close second. Was able to pick that one up on release day!

Munch‚Äôs Oddysee was one of the first video games I ever played, and I immediately fell in love with the Oddworld universe. I love that the games tackle some very dark themes, but they never forget to throw in jokes and banter to brighten the mood. The character and creatures designs are also superb! It‚Äôs a very charming series, and remains one of my favorites!

North America

I've only ever played New 'n' Tasty on Wii U (which was fun but quite buggy due to a shoddy port job), but the series has a lot of charm and I'm glad we're getting more entries in the series on Nintendo platforms.

I'm in North America. Thanks for this giveaway!

My favorite will have to be Oddworld Abe‚Äôs Exoddus. PS1. Definitely enjoyed being able to control the paramites and scrabs. Also occasionally being able to turn into the shrykull was awesome! Western region USA.

gotta go with abe's exoddus, it improved on everything that made the original game great, although i have yet to play munch's oddysey or stranger's wrath\\

USA

Oh man what a hard choice. I think my favorite Oddworld game has to go to Strangers Wrath. It is the one that I recommend to everyone when discussing overlooked games and I have always wanted a sequel to it. There is just something so cool about Stranger and the setting that sets it apart from the other Oddworld games. Granted I may think Abe's Oddysee is the better game in terms of artistic vision and execution but Strangers Wrath is a game that defined the classic Xbox for me and I have yet to see any game do what it did in terms of creative gameplay concepts. I even made a whole fan-moveset for him as an example of what unique mechanics he could bring to the table if he was added to Super Smash Brothers.

North America

North America here, and my favorite would have to be strangers wrath!! My boyfriend has a switch, and I'll play on it sometimes when he's not using it, but I'm saving up to get my own switch so I can get more game time in. Haha
Although, I am SO excited about Soulstorm!! I have my own PC and will be able to actually play!!

My favorite game from Oddworld is New n Tasty! Such a good ground-up remake of a classic game.

Illinois, USA

The original Abe's Oddissey is still my most fondly remembered game of the series. My region is in Europe.

\"Stranger's Wrath\", baby!!

I thoroughly enjoyed it on the original Xbox! I downloaded/bought it on my Android phone AND my iPad, but the touch controls were a little weird for me.
I've since bought it for the Switch and currently reliving some great memories!!
Playing it on this special console is the only thing I can think of that would make it better!!

North America (Kentucky)

Munchies Odyssey was the game I picked out along side my xbox that winter, It was like Christmas for the remainder of the year.

My favorite Oddworld game is probably Munch's Oddysee. The story and characters are enough to always keep me coming back for more.
USA

Munch's Oddysee introduced me to the franchise and have been a fan since.
North America

Abe's Odyssey is by far the one I spent the most time with. Did some fan art of it as a kid, maybe the only game I've ever drawn art about.

North America, Thanks!

Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee! What an adventure and story.

I live in the US.

Oddworld: Abe's Exodus was my first introduction and is still one of my all time favorite games. It's probably sad but I still quote it and on random days can be heard mimicking Abe's voice and just goofing around with lines from it! Not much else to do here in Illinois!!

I've been playing oddworld games since the original Abe's Oddyssey...which is still my favorite. USA

Oddworld abes exodus is my favorite! It keeps the original feel of abes oddysee while adding more game mechanics and adding to the lore. Lorne Lanning is amazing when it comes to imagination, giving us games that really encapsulate us into the story and giving us characters that we truely feel for!

Idaho, USA

My favorite Oddworld is Abe's Odyssey, I played it with my father when it came out and we finished it together. Europe (Spain)

Oddworld Abe‚Äôs exodus is my favorite oddworld game so far in the released games. I also liked the gameboy color games as a kid.and yes I‚Äôm in Seattle WA.

My favorite game would have to be the PlayStation original, ODD WORLD: ABE'S EXODDUS. This game was my childhood, I loved it and it will always be my favorite side scrolling action game. IN ODD WE TRUST!!

North-East, United States of America

Abe's Oddysee was actually the first time a game ever made me feel something more than just playing a game. The dark humour was completely new to me as a kid and it honestly blew my mind growing up and definitely helped shape who I am today.

As I worked in warehouses; I saw how relevant and depressingly accurate the theming was and fell in love with the series again. It's amazing what Lorne has managed to achieve and one day I would really like to do the same!

(England here (sadly)).

Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus hands down! The art, the ominous moments, and the toughness makes it my top 3 favorite games of all time! <3

North America

Stranger‚Äôs Wrath is my all-time favorite game EVER!! ‚ù§Ô∏è

North America (USA, WA)

When i was a little kid, then we played a lot Abe‚Äôs Oddysee with my friend. Much later, i found Stranger's Wrath, that was also a big surprise and fun for me (:

Europe/Germany

My favorite is Oddworld New 'n' Tasty. North America

My favorite game from Oddworld is definitely Strangers Wrath. The story in the game is very engaging very fun interacts with the chicken people and I also loved the different types of ammunition. Stranger is definitely the best bounty hunter out there!!

USA

Stranger's Wrath has a warm place in my heart. I ended up moving to San Luis Obispo and found out later that the original studio was located downtown. So of course I exploited my newspaper job to write a story about the studio and interview Sherry McKenna. (I'm in the North America region.)

I know this is for Stranger‚Äôs Wrath but I am an aging gamer. The original Abe‚Äôs Oddysee changed how I viewed games forever. It wasn‚Äôt about shooting everything anymore. Communication was the main mechanic and such a fresh new and tasty way to enjoy an adventure. The world of the game was intoxicating and the cut-scenes were like a feature film to my young gamer brain. Was my favorite game of all time from that point forward. Thanks! North America Inhabitant.

Munch's Oddyssee captivated me when it came out. Not just adorable Munch, but the disturbing medical themes and the interwoven continuation of Abe's story. I would draw Munch and the Vykkers in school because I loved their designs.

I think I have to go with Abe's Odyssey. I was young and have it a chance. I didn't know how hard it was going to be but I did my best and I eventually beat (bad ending first). Good times.

USA, here.

Strangers wrath! It was the very first game I ever beat. I was 8 on the original Xbox. I will always have a spot in my heart for that amazing game. I'm in the United States.

Abe's Oddysee was the first game I ever played on the PlayStation and I've been a fan of the series ever since. North America here.

I love Munch's Oddysey. I remember this coming out on Xbox while the two previous games were on PlayStation. I decided to pick it up, and I was not disappointed! The funny characters and challenging puzzles, along with the dazzling Glukkons, all served as the perfect recipe for an amazing Oddworld game!
I'm from the Bay Area, CA, U.S.

Exxodus was my favorite Oddworld game, namely because the gameplay expanded on the first one AND you could be the Shrykull more than once, but honestly, I owe the entire franchise my life, mainly because they helped shape my socio-political ideologies at such a tong age that now I'm hyper-aware of such things as oligarchy-esque corruption in our world today.

Thank you, Lorne, and the entire Oddworld team for helping a young boy turn into a narrative-questioning adult!!

i‚Äôve only played new n tasty but im interested in more games. i only have xbox so being able to play on switch would be great :D from America

I played the first game on a retro system me and my dad played it together when i was younger about 6 or 7 good times

I grew up with the whole Oddworld franchise as a kid, but Abe's Odyssey will always have a place in my heart. Especially the anarchist, pro-enviromentalist elements and aspect of the game. The Oddworld franchise gave me a whole new outlook on life, and one that'll never change, so much so, that I'm even planning on getting Abe's face tatt'd on my arm. Thank you Lorne! And thank you Oddworld Inhabitants!
(United States)

Strangers wrath HD for vita. I keep going back to it

I‚Äôve played them all! Love them all since I was a kid. My fav is Abe‚Äôs Exoddus. Loved that game and the new anger/sadness system. Always look forward to anything you guys do. I‚Äôm North America (West Virginia).

abes odyssey is my favourite because it gives me so many memories of being a stupid little baby that can only just use a ps1 controller and cannot comprehend a video game ü§§üòç

im from Europe

Exoddus is my favourite honestly, despite it being the rushed product. I just loved the environments more, and the ability to control and blow up Sligs with farts!

My dad got my into Oddworld when I was little, and it's stayed one of my favourite game franchises of all time since. I've completed every game now, and am eagerly waiting for Soulstorm!!

UK / EU here

Originals my fav

Wow! I‚Äôve played many Oddworld games but my first and favorite was Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee. It was obsessed with it as a kid and even bought a VHS walkthrough tape to help me get through some parts üòÇ. Sometimes I still boot it up on my PS1. Hi from North America.

Also want to add that the graphics at the time of that titles release were amazing! The creepy but cool cutscenes and in-game Sligs. Loved seeing how the franchise progressed over the years into even having a shooter!

My first Oddworld game was Munch‚Äôs Oddysee, but my favorite is Strangers Wrath. I love the western style and ability to use different creatures to subdue your enemies!

Washington state, United States here!

I loved these games; love Elum, Abe and Munch! I can't wait for this North America/California.

Abe‚Äôs Odyssey has had a huge influence on my life and my career path. The entire Oddworld franchise is fantastic.

Abes Exodus for me. Loved those funny cinematics as a kid&teenager back then. :)

My last post seems to have disappeared üò¢

Easily oddworld stranger's wrath. I grew up with this game on t he original xbox and it always kept me coming back for just the world and how it felt to play. The sound design is some of the best in my opinion.

United states

Oddworld Abe's Oddysee of course! Played the original on the pc when it came in packaging the size of a cereal box. It's also how I met my wife. I would still like to see Sligstorm and Hand of Odd please - are you listening Lorne? - USA

My dad used to have a red and silver Bronco, this was like 1996, the stick went straight through the floor and revealed the road beneath constantly. So my dad would toss his cigarettes down this hole onto the moving asphalt and I‚Äôd watch the ember bounce and spark and I would be mesmerized. I played Abe‚Äôs Oddysee a lot when I was this age, but that was the last time I remember his bronco or cigarettes being ‚Äòneat‚Äô. I listened to some presidents of the United States (peaches kitty etc) recently and had the realization I‚Äôve avoided this franchise for a long time because feelings and my pops.
Crazy what some sounds or smells can make you think of entire lives. Sillier yet that one of these for me is the opening screen with Abe‚Äôs goofy ass face loll. Think I‚Äôll pick this up for the switch ü§î

USA az

Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee was my favorite. I played both Playstation games, and loved them. USA

Stranger's Wrath is definitely my favorite Oddworld game, mainly because of the story.
Europe

Strangers Wrath is my favourite by far. America.

I played all of Oddworld games. My favorite one is Abe's Oddysee. I like Abe's Exoddus too but nothing beats the original. I remember when I first played it on the Playstation demo disc, the gameplay was extremely unique and new at the time! with the release of New 'n' Tasty, it brought so much nostalgic memories and I couldn't help but buying it on every console I own. I hope it gets a Nintendo Switch port soon!

USA

Ahhh! Odd world Strangers Wrath is my favorite!

My name is Jacqueline and I‚Äôm from North America :)

Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee was in my top 3 games on Ps1. Spent hours on that one.

I love new n tasty because of how fast it is we‚Äôll depend on the difficulty that is I also love the world it‚Äôs set in because it‚Äôs strange and new and all the creatures look amazing and different

honestly have not played a lot of offworld, recently bought some of the games on OG xbox and once my holiday startts, I do plan to spend some time with it

I gotta go with stranger‚Äôs wrath for my favorite. I love the Oddworld theme mixed with wild wild west and ‚Äústeampunk‚Äù hints. The story still is interesting and uniquely told and I can‚Äôt wait to see a second game or story about Stranger. A truly beloved game for me. Sincerely from North America, Chicago, Illinois.

Abe's Exodus is my favorite of the Oddworld series. I found the storyline with Soulsrorm Brew and the blind Mudokons very engaging. Plus you could possess your own farts and make them explode! I love the entire Oddworld series though, they all hold a special place for me.
I'm in the United States. Montana if you wanna get specific.

This looks so awesome! Some of my fondest moments was finding my dad's oddworld games as a kid and playing them behind his back. We also freaked out when Oddysee got a remake and we pulled an all nighter and skipped school/work to beat it.

Definitely strangers wrath. Played it on original Xbox. Wished there was more steef though

My favorite is Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee.

Strangers wrath: no spoilers but the ending is incredible and unforgettable. Reigon:US

So I grew up with Abes exodus since my dad loved to show me games from his childhood and I LOVE IT it‚Äôs 100% my favourite game of ALL TIME so it definitely my favourite game from the odd world of oddworld

So thx for years of good times :)

(Europe, Uk)

Region: North America. New England area. When I was a kid, I found out about Abe's Oddyssee and Exoddus. I've been obsessed with Oddworld since. Oddworld makes high quality games time after time. All of their games are astonishing with phenomenal writing, addictive gameplay, and enchanting cutscenes. I always hope that when I am done with college, that I will be able to work with Oddworld Inhabitants someday. That will always be the dream I aspire towards. I know it seems like a bit much to put for a comment, but I just adore how hard the Oddworld Inhabitants team work to make such outstanding games and I would love that signed console. Keep up the good work and I hope everyone on the team stays safe!

Munches Oddysee and Strangers Wrath were mine and my dad favorite games growing up we just love the sense of humor that me and him talk about to this day still, one my favorite memories with him!

USA here!

Definetely Abe's Exoddus, it was one of my first pc games and I instantly fell in love with such an amazing and unique universe.

Italy/ Europe

From Europe here. I always played Munch's Odyssey with my dad when I was younger, it was the first game I really got into and I have really fond memories of it :')

Munch's Oddysee will always have a spot in my heart. I'd like to think it was the very first video game I'd ever played when I was barely a few years old. It was only the gamespeak menu, but i grew into proper play and it still remains one of my all-time favorites

United States Oregon

It's really hard for me to pick a favorite. I love them all. I started with Abe's oddysee on the original Playstation ( first console that I owned. Thanks Mom!!) growing up and have played every game since. I have so many memories and all my games still. Playstation, Xbox, GBA. Didn't matter what system I just wanted to play Oddworld. I think Strangers Wrath has to top my list though. It was a whole new look at the universe and I love it!!!! I have played for so many hours. The whole thing is just so well put together and so creative. I will forever love the Oddworld Universe and hope to see so much more come from it.
Region: North America

I played Oddworld on PS and PS2 years ago. That was my favorite game then. I would love playing that game recently. Hello from Europe!

I am new to the oddworld series but I have spent most of my time playing through the games and learning as much as I can about the series, I am so looking forward for the new game. Overall if I had to pick my favorite Oddworld game it would have to be Stanger's Wrath. I have always liked western style games/movies so this one is my all time favorite. Weslaco TX

I'd have to say it has to be Stranger's Wrath, that gritty western feel was somwthing I had not played before. It was always colorful Mario and such. But Stranger had that appeal I still love to this day.

I remember riding my bike to video ezy just to rent Abe's odyssey and staying up all weekend in absolute bliss. No other game on the ps1 could compare to the visual arts and compelling story.

I feel like the first two games made up a significant part of my childhood and cannot wait for Lorne Lanning's true vision to come to fruition with exodus, which is my favourite.

Playing these games as an adult is as much joy as when I played them for the first time 20 years ago.

The story will always hold an extraordinary place in my heart.

Thank you from Australia üá¶üá∫! ‚ù§

Abe's Oddysee has always been my favorite. It was my first PS1 game and will always hold a special place in my heart. North America Region.

I‚Äôve been a hardcore Oddworld fan ever since I was a toddler, I‚Äôve played Oddworld Abe‚Äôs Exoddus on the playstation 1 since I was 5 years old and its so far my favorite Oddworld game of all time! I hope I can win the Stranger‚Äôs Wrath theme Switch! I live in the USA Region!

Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee, grew up with that one, spent endless nights on it, loved every aspect of it! bring on the future of Abe!

Odd world munches odyssey was fun from what i could remember I was a kid so I only got to play it when we would go to k-mart that had a demo of it there I wanted to buy it but never could back thenwpuodnbe awesome to finally be able to enjoy the actual game. I have completed the ps1 odd world though it was a great game especially the little leach things they were terrifying lol that and the two legged dog aliens

Oddworld has always been one of my favorite video game franchises. I‚Äôm super excited to play Soulstorm when it comes out! So far, Abe‚Äôs Oddysee is my favorite!

United States

Growing up strangers wrath was my favorite game to watch my sister play, I watched her play it to completion and then one day while I asked both my mom, and my sister if I could play strangers wrath. I had played munches audicy in the past and a few other oddworld titles but this one was different. I was in love with the bounty hunter deal and the cartoony old cowboy vibes it gave me, one day my mom came home to me playing it and told me I was not allowed to play it anymore because it was too violent! This was outrageous we played plenty of other violent games, my sister argued twords my side but for the first week or so my mom was relentless, she gave in and got to play the game, probably due to the fact that I was also into games like burnout and we constantly where playing smash Bros, but I think it's pretty funny because strangers wrath is the only game my mom had ever band me from playing half way through üòÇ.
From Washington State US.

I have great memories Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus on ps1. I cant wait to play the new game.

USA

For the story, gameplay and of course the awesome soundtrack \"Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee\" played on PS1 at the release, until today still the best game played on Playstation era, now waiting for NNT release for Switch! üñ§
from Rhode Island. (US)

I have such fond memories of the whole Oddworld franchise, me and my dad played it a ton when I was young and now I‚Äôm watching him play new n tasty on the ps4. It‚Äôd been cool to show him the one Oddworld he didn‚Äôt get to play.

United States here

My all-time favorite has to be Abe‚Äôs Exoddus. You guys built upon the first game in terms of mechanics (All o‚Äô ya was a life saver lol) and you introduced some pretty funny characters. The trio of Glukkons at the FeeCo Depot are by far my favorite. Not to mention the soundtrack! Plus the introduction of Fleeches (which I both loved and hated lol) all-in-all, I totally loved it, but now I‚Äôm SUPER excited for SoulStorm because I know you guy FINALLY get to tell the TRUE story that follows Abe after Oddysee. And I love how even darker and grittier it is!! I‚Äôm a bit saddened by the lack of Dripek and Phleg but I‚Äôll get over it for a great game with even greater mechanics!

Region: North America

Oddworld Abe's Odyssey is my favorite and it blew me away when I first played it as a kid. It was different from all the other media that I had experienced and so many of its messages still hold true today.

My favorite game that a tough one to pick from between Munch's oddessy/stranger wrath & new & tasty. but If i got pick one of the 3 def Munch's oddessy since that was first game i got for xbox & loved every bit of it! my favorite part was actually in menu settings where you can make Abe fart & Munch Burp that i started trying to make music out of it in main menu lol. would def do this again if it available on switch menu lol

North America

I love MO cuz that‚Äôs the first oddworld game I played. But all the oddworld games are amazing.

From America!

I played Munch‚Äôs Odyssey and Strangers Wrath like my life depended on it with my oversized THE DUKE controller. I remember starting to religiously drink sprite because of the ad imagery in Munch‚Äôs xD easily one of my favorite franchises of all time. Love the OddWorld!!! North America

Strangers Wrath became my favorite after the OG odd world games. It took the universe to another level! Love it as a kid.

Springfield, IL - USA

I started playing as a kid with abe's oddessy my m9m had to help me cause it was so hard but i loved every aspect of the game. My favorite though is stranger wrath because of all the creature and huge world building. Im from denver Colorado USA. My name is Kyle singer. Hope this is enough info. I need me a switch plus that fuzzy case is everything.

My absolute favorite has to be munch's oddysee. It was the first time I ever saw oddworld!
United states

Munch's Oddysee was my favorite because I love the fuzzles! I am in the North America region.

Strangers Wrath was the first oddworld game I have memory of seeing, I believe it was some gameplay on G4. I was intrigued so I went down to blockbuster and rented it. I loved it and ended up buying a copy to own. Since then, I've played Odyssey and Exodus, and looked more into Oddworld games. I was surprised to find out that the old studio was literally right around the corner from me in SLO. Now, every time I walk by the old door (used to be labeled with Oddworld Inhabitants, now it's a calpoly internship center) I always tell my friends about Oddworld.

United States

I've been a fan in the USA since the original Abe's Oddysee on both the PC and PSX, but it was Exoddus that stole my heart. I made sure I saved EVERY mudokon, and I enjoyed every minute of it. The only game I haven't played is Stranger's Wrath.

I bought Oddworld: Stranger‚Äôs Wrath when it first game out on Xbox 360, then I broke and I was unable to complete the game :‚Äô(

Purchased again for the mobile phone port years later, and again for a reason I can‚Äôt remember now, I was unable to finish it.

So would love the chance to actually play through fully and complete the game on Nintendo Switch! Fingers crossed ü§ûüèº
Thank you.

Region: Europe (UK)

My region is USA and my favorite game will always be munch's oddysee. I've bought it on every system I can and it was the first xbox game i ever played a long time ago at the store display.

Abe's Exoddus is my favorite oddworld game ever. I've played it 10+ times. US here, want that switch!

Abe's Oddysee on Xbox was the first one I ever played, and the first Xbox game I ever finished. I was blown away and still am. That will always be my favorite. Stranger's Wrath was incredible as well but Abe and Munch are my faves. Region: USA

Loved Abe from the beginning all the phrases and farts and more. Strangers Wrath is... ugh... if I have to say my fav for one by a bit. I'm in North America :) I love this design so much!! It is fluffy!!!

I loved Abe's Odyssey and Stranger's Wrath. When New n' Tasty came out I hopped on that immediately upon release.

United States here

I know it‚Äôs clich√© but I really enjoy all of oddworld inhabitants games. But if I had to choose just one I would choose Oddworld Munch‚Äôs Odyssey because I never get tired of playing it because it so challenging to play! Also I‚Äôm located in the United States!

Stranger's Wrath. Gameplay, story, the \"live\" ammo, it was all great.

I played and bought all the Oddworld games! My absolute favorites! It's really hard to choose... But the best for me is Oddworld Abe's Oddysee! I remember when I was a child and the first time I finished it I became very sad for not having saved all the Mudokons and a shock for being dead! So I played so much and finally I saved them all! Best game ever!

Italy/Europe

Playing Abe's Oddysee on Demo 1 over and over and over until I could afford the whole thing withy pocket money, still to this day the first game I think of when someone asks \"what's the first game you loved\". UK Europe.

Abe's odyssey was a classic and st I'll ll one my favorite.

I think I'm the minority here but I really loved Munch's Oddysee most of all Oddworld games!

The game I have the most memories playing has to be Munch's Oddysee. One of my favorite games to play on the original xbox. I'm very happy to see the oddoworld series alive and strong. Washington state here.

My favorite Oddworld game has to be Stranger‚Äôs Wrath on Switch. The gyro aiming added so much to an already well written, well designed, one of a kind shooter. I‚Äôve played through it twice and haven‚Äôt gotten tired of it yet! California, US.

Probably Abe's Exoddus even though it might not be the fan favorite

Oddworld Munch's Oddysee brings so much childhood joy for me, I really enjoyed being able to bring the fight to the Sligs and Vykkers! Gathering my Mudokon homies and Fuzzles to fight against them was so memorable!

I love all the oddworld games but my favorite one is strangers wrath it's just really neat and fun to play. Need to have all of these on the switch.

My favorite has to be Abe's Oddysee which I grew up playing on the Playstation. Also caused me to misspell Odyssey into my early teens. I'm in the North America region.

Canada / North America

As a kid my cousin had a demo for Abe‚Äôs Oddysee. I‚Äôve spent countless hours playing it, not have a PlayStation of my own. So naturally Abe‚Äôs Oddysee is my favourite.

Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus best of the best

North American oddworld fan can‚Äôt wait for soul storm and I loved new and tasty just finished stranger On switch for the first time awhile back üòÑ

My favorite and first game was Munch's Odyssey. I played it sooooo much. I liked being abe and possessing people. Or just wheeling around as munch in a wheelchair hopped up on Espresso. Saving fuzzles. Etc. Ahh great game. I don't own a switch but man it would be great to have this one. So many games I could get into again. United States. :)

I got Abe's Odyssey when i was 5 for the ps1 and it quickly became my favorite game, there really wasnt any other game that could match up against the dark yet commical feel of the original. Out here in North America B-)

Abe's Exoddus! I especially love when you had to control sligs to unlock certain doors!
-Oklahoma, United States

My partner is the biggest Oddworld fan I've ever met, we met on a games design course at university and since have been together over 6 years with a fantastic child called Link. We had to debate whether to call him Abe because of how much she's obsessed with the Oddworld universe. She has Tatoos of Abe riding an Elum on her left leg, and the Stranger on her right leg. Not only this but she screamed the most fan girl scream I've ever heard when she had Lorne Lanning follow her on Twitter. On the off chance I finally win something I would adore being able to give her this, the ultimate gift. And would have to record her reaction when receiving it for all of social media to see. I sincerely hope I get a chance of winning this!!! Region: UK Favourite game: Munchs Odyssey

I have to go with Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath. The first person perspective brought a breath of fresh air to the series, while the \"live ammo\" mechanic brought some much needed humor to the fps genre. The Chippunks still crack me up! With it's unique gameplay and unforgettable story, Stranger's Wrath is hands down, the cream of the crop.

-New Hampshire, USA.

my first love is still Abe's Oddysee cause it was so just different from anything else i had played when it first came out. I fell in love with the environment and story and the characters. Strangers Wrath is my second fav because i just love that bounty hunter with a secret vibe, and using live ammo was cute and innovative as well. I do plan on doing a human fem version of Stranger, for a cosplay, sometime in the near
future. [north america]

USA here,

I still have Abe‚Äôs Odyssey and Exodus on PS1, but I have a special love for Strangers Wrath. Also don‚Äôt got a switch yet so this would be double lovely for me! Love your work. Stefan.

My favorite its Oddworld Abes Odysee, I like mostly the original games but would love the chance and opportunity to play the new games. Im in the US. My name is Amber Fowler

I think my favorite would have to be Abe's Oddysee, because I have so.many fond memories of playing with my family. We absolutely love series.

I grew up watching my dad play these games so they had a big influence on me. I have to say that Exoddus is my absolute favorite of the series since it improved upon a lot of the things that made the first game great, though I have a feeling soulstorm might take the place of #1 when it comes out!

Texas, USA

My all time favorite game is still Oddworld Abes Odysee. I remember playing it when my dad was still enjoying his brand new Playstation 1, and never quite got the hang of the first level as a kid.

Strangers wrath has always been one of my favorite games. I played through it as a child on the original Xbox when it came out, and I absolutely fell in love with the world. I played through it again on pc with the hd remaster and even on mobile.

United States/ North America

Im from Washington north America and my favorite oddworld game has to be munchs oddysee. I have played it multiple times throughout my life and its still as fun as the first time I played it. I love oddworlds art style and its hard not to care for these heroes. When I was little I looked up to abe and munch these two caring and oppressed creatures finding there inner power and fighting against the evil corporations. It gets me excited, inspired and wanting to play it again just talking about it. Even if I don't win I still get a new oddworld game to play. thanks for all your hard work on the games everyone involved.

I liked the cartoony antics and story of Oddworld- New N‚Äô Tasty. Looking forward to the Switch releases! - North America

Grew up playing Oddworld on PS1 and truly believe IMO it is the greatest platform puzzle game ever made.

I loved playing Abe's oddysee, I had it on PlayStation when I was growing up. I loved being able to control the slots and make other oddworld inhabitants laugh at my fart noises, too bad I never got to beat the game.. I got stuck at the red claw guys, I don't remember the names..

Abe's Oddysee was the first game I played on a console. My dad brought a PS1 home and said \"I saw this game dont tell your mom it has guns in it\". I was hooked. More than 20 years later I've played every Oddworld game and I can't wait for Soulstorm!

Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus
Region: Europe

North America here! I used to watch my uncle 100% complete Abe's oddyssey over and over again so I could watch the cg movies, because I was awful at the game. My favorite game to play myself was stranger's wrath on the xbox. I must have played through that game 6 times in a row.

My all time favorite game no doubt has to be Munches Oddesy. That game in particular was so far ahead of its time. The memories I have with my dad watching him play the side scrollers were always bitter sweet; but it wasn't until Munches Oddesy came around I was finally old enough to fully immerse myself within the Oddworld universe, and since then gaming has never been the same. whether I win or not, I am beyond excited these guys are back! Love and light. - Justin Marchant (Chicago IL, North America}

My favorite oddworld game hands down is strangers wrath! So many people have never heard of it nor played it! Sad its not on xbox and it honestly doesnt make sense because oddworld was originally for xbox i thought, eh but anyways throw the console my way! United States

I loved Abe‚Äôs Odysee the most because of its simplicity and because of the rise in power from being a slave janitor to a savior.

Abes oddysee is perhaps the most special to me. It was one of my first video games and I love it. But Strangers not only surprised me. I found as great as Abe. Fun gameplay and amazing plot.

My favorite Oddworld is Oddworld Abe‚Äôs Exodus!

I've played them all love all your games oddworld very unique games one of a kind. My favourite has to be the original Abe's oddesey I mean that's where it all began right? I have this game played to death. I'm in Ireland, Europe

Abe‚Äôs Exodus and Odyssey are my all time favorite games ever in my life lol I recently bought new n tasty, stranger, and munch on my phone. Absolutely love them.

It all started when I was young being introduced to gaming by my uncle who raised me like his own, he got me an xbox and one of the 1st games he got for me was Munch's Oddysee.

He's dead now but the memories of games like this constantly flutter back from time to time, and how those games shaped me as a person and taste.

Me and him had a hell of a time with that game especially when I was younger cause I found the puzzles hard.

All and all we also played stranger's wrath together, and every time we thought odd world was finally down for the count they managed to come back and keep a good memory alive.

I hope I can relive these games when I have a kid and they will enjoy them as much as I did even after I'm gone.

I know you guys think you just make games but there's people who's lives you have a effected and you have made memories for me when my uncle was alive I'll never be able to replace.

It's so hard writing this, but just know for some of us the world's you made are so special.

I might not win anything and that's fine just glad I got to share this with someone.

Abe‚Äôs oddyssee was my very first computer game ! Such a fun game collection all the workers And the music was top notch. United States

I absolutely adore Abe's Odyssey. Its genuinely a really, really fun game. I love the sidescrolling action and adventure that it is. Its also incredibly funny!

I've played all Oddworld games but New 'N Tasty takes the prize as my favorite.
I spent days and days as a kid trying to beat Abe's Oddysee and barely did i knew that it would bring me memories for the rest of my life.

New 'N Tasty picked up my nostalgia googles and upgraded them, as the game still felt as the original, but everything looked so much better without loosing anything, which a lot of re-makes fail to do.

Man I love them all. But the OG was my fave of them all with munch‚Äôs a close second. Austin Texas USA !

I've played them all so it's hard to pick a favorite, but I'd say Munch's Oddysee was my favorite, I like all the puzzles, possession, and combat enough to play it several times over, even trying for different amounts of karma for new endings, great game.

My favorite one is Abe‚Äôs Exoddus

My favorite of the Oddworld series is Abe's Oddessey. It started the whole thing and even today holds us so well due to the storyline and gameplay.

Abes Odyssey, loved the story line and the graphics at the time were awesome. I have all the Oddworld games, but the best character has to be Abe.

Ive grown up playing these games with my dad. Definitely will always be a sacred bitter sweet memory I have of my childhood, watched him play the side scrollers for hours till Munches Oddesy came out and I was finally old enough to grasp the content of the game and since then has changed the way I view video games, and their content. Odd world inhabitants never disappoints. Whether I win or not I am beyond happy to see these guys back at doing what they do best! Love and lightüåç

My favorite Oddworld game is Abe‚Äôs Exodus. I‚Äôve been playing the games since I was a wee baby toddler. Theymre my fav.

I got hooked on the Oddworld series after getting the pc game through work. When the original Xbox came out I bought oddworld munch's oddysee. First game I ever finished. (Never was good at games.) Sure would like to give it a go again on the Switch. Awesome fuzzle box. Awesome giveaway/promotion.

Nothing quite beats the original Abe's Oddysee for me! North American region :)

Oddworld's 'Abe's odyssey' was one of the first games I remember playing, coming out on the year of my birth I was late to play the game, but once I played, I never stopped, 24 years later, I continue to enjoy the oppressive atmosphere and the quirky antics of protagonist Abe. Even if I don't win... It's nice to share my love for this game. <3

Oddworld Stranger was my favourite. I have brought this game 5 x already it never gets old

ill Play from the First time all oddworlds :*

I really like New and tasty. But out of all 3 times i have played i have never saved 100% but its ok just to hear GET EMM. Hope the new one has a way to help keep better track, and still possessed farts.üòÅüòÅ

I'd have to say my favorite is strangers wrath but I love the odd world universe. I'm in the United States

My favorite Oddworld game is Exoddus because of the new characters to possess. Can't wait to play the new game!!

Abe's Oddesy is my all time favorite. I still have my PS2 and play it! It's actually the game that got me into video games. North America, Cincinnati, Ohio.

I really like strangers wrath. The game flow is great, characters are unique, the ammo has soo much character. Also a great story with loads of twists.

Would be great to win the console, it's an awesome coustum. :D

I remember sending an email to oddworld inhabitants begging for information about the next oddworld game after I played the first 3. I recieved a letter in the mail with a picture of stranger and the caption \"Things are about to get a lot stranger\" and because of that strangers wrath always felt special to me.

I'm in the U.S

I think Exoddus was my favorite Oddworld title, but I will forever and always be in love with Elum. I don‚Äôt know why...really, he‚Äôs barely in the game. But I love his honey-loving self lol. I‚Äôm in the US...Ohio to be precise.

Personally, oddworld Munches Odyssey.
It came out when I was a little kid, it was fantastically mind blowing. I fell in love with the game and real quick and have loved it ever since, made me convince my dad to buy a PS1 when I was younger so I could play the originals! These games are priceless and good for all ages! Amazing even as an adult

United States here :)

I love the original game for PS. That was the strangest game I have played and I was like 8 years old when I got it. I‚Äôm in the North America region

My favorite Oddworld game was Abe‚Äôs Exoddus. I just remember that opening cutscene hitting and being so enthralled. US region!

The switch versions are the only ones I've ever played and I really love them. Can't wait to find out what the third unannounced Oddworld game for switch will be.

Abe‚Äôs Exoddus -I loved all the characters and environments in Oddworld but I was only 4 when Oddysee was released (had an older brother who bought it) so it was super difficult for me to play, BUT when exoddus came out, it had quick save, using that made the game a lot easier so I was able to really progress and get into it more. It was always hold a special place for me, the humor, the characters, everything was amazing, and to this day still holds up as a great game!! Region is North American- USA

Love New ‚ÄòN Tasty!

I really like strangers wrath. The game flow is great, characters are unique, the ammo has soo much character. Also a great story with loads of twists.

Favorite game in the oddworld series is easily Strangers Wrath. Steefs are so badass, I hope they are included in more oddworld games. The reason why I enjoyed it though was the message about being true to ones self (embrace the steef!) and the enviormental message.

North America (US)

My favourite game was easily the first, Abes oddysee, I played as a kid and its messages and characters always stayed with me and helped shape the person I have become. Have always been a diehard fan of everything oddworld since then.

Strangers wrath hands down was my childhood game for sure. The amount of endless gameplay, unique characters and bounty‚Äôs had my hands glued to the controller till the very end! Even after I wanted to play again and again to explore the world itself! Oddworld Inhabitants forever!

My favorite game is the two disc playstation 1 Abe's Odyssey and Abe's Exodus. I got this game on Easter morning along with the playstation. It brought a lot of enjoyment for many hours for my entire family.
From North America

Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus is one of my favorite games of all time. The series had a huge creative influence on me growing up, starting with Exoddus on the PS1 at 6 years old (28 now). I'm from the U.S.

Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee on PlayStation 1 console was my first ever game i played before any other games. My dad was presented by the playstation 1 console when it was launched and we had a demo CD with few games, Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee was the first for me to try. After that we got a full version of the game. This was my favorite game since then.

Melbourne, Australia

Abe's Exoddus was my first and still my favorite Oddworld title. Scared the piss out of me when I was little, but man the atmosphere is THICK. Oregon USA here!

I've played every game! Abe's Oddysee was also my first game completion, an autistic boy at 18 months old back in 1998. Not too bad eh ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Love your games, make more pls ü•∞. England, UK, Europe

I'd say my favorite is Munch's Oddysee, while it wasn't the first Oddworld game I had seen it was the first one I was able to play!

Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus. I have so many font memories with the first two games but Exoddus is just slightly better

Strangers Wrath is not only my favorite Odd World game. But it‚Äôs up in my top 10. It was a breath of fresh air with the live ammo and level designs. Great concepts and vision. Too bad a sequel was never made. Maybe on the PS5?

I loved the original Abe‚Äôs Odyssey. Played it to death on my PlayStation. Europe / UK here.

I remember the first time playing Abe's Oddysee and Abe's Exoddus on PlayStation and can only recall that I absolutely loved the experience, so both of these are my favs ^^

Europe here ^^

Love Abe's games and Munch

Colorado, USA

Abe's Exodus will always be my favorite. My first introduction to the series was from an old OPM demo disc, and I couldn't wait to get my hands on the full version.

As for the contest, I'm in North America!

Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee. one of my childhood hero. Hands down.

I remember playing the original oddworld with my best friend on an old school PC great memories

I love the original Oddworld. Abe is such a compelling character- an unwilling hero that becomes great :) and does great things.

Oddworld Abe‚Äôs Odyssey is an incredible game that brings back great memories from the 90s. I enjoyed every game in the series, and look forward to many more years playing them! [North America]

Abe‚Äôs odyssey is definitely my all time favorite PlayStation game! I had to get the new and tasty when it came out but the original ps game is the best ‚Äúhello‚Äù

I was on and off of Oddworld games til Stranger's Wrath. It fit my tastes then, and started gaining appreciation of the Oddworld universe. Since then it was always my favored game of the series. Loved his gravely voice style.

North America.

Strangers Wrath!!!

Strangers wrath for sure! Nostalgia :)

England here!

A few of my first games on the PS1 was oddworld and exodduss. Was so excited to hear a new game was being made but never gave munch the love because it's all about Abe!

I remember the first Oddworld, always my personal fav, coming out when i was like 5. It was one of the first games I ever played and it blew my mind with it's unique world and art style. IIRC, my first taste was in that sick pizza hut demo disc xD. Had to have it after I got a taste. Loved the series ever since and I can't wait for more!
[Usa]

North America - Abe's Exoddus has always been my fave, ever since my mom and I played it and Oddysee when I was a kid. We still regularly talk at each other in our best Abe voices.

Munch's Odyssey! It was one of the first games I played with my dad and we both fell in love with it. I've gone back sooo many times to play it in my adulthood and still holds a dear place in my heart. Even though I love all of the Oddworld games.

USA

Oddworld Abe's Oddysee was the first I played and my favorite, I loved playing it again with New 'N Tasty.

USA in North America here.

Strangers Wrath is my favorite oddworld game with Abes odyssey coming in at a close second. I'm ready for more oddworld too! North america here!

My favorite Oddworld game has to be Strangers Wrath. I remember just how unique it was compared to the other games and absolutely love the setting in which the game takes place.

US here!

Both myself and my fiancee enjoyed Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus. Definitely had hours of fun playing. The cutscene with the boiler still makes us laugh. We are based in the UK/Europe. Good luck to everyone who has entered so far!

Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus, it was so strange and charming. I love that the Oddworld games are willing to be unique. I'm in North America.

I remember playing Abe's Odyssey on PS1 as a child and trying but failing (miserably!) To save everyone üòÇ

I am from Europe (UK).

Played the one that was on the OG Xbox and was hooked. Fond memories of the title and been wanting to come back on my newer systems!

Region USA

Stranger's Wrath was not only my favorite Oddworld but my favorite game as a kid. I used to lug around my Xbox to play it wherever I went lol. That game is a masterpiece.

Oddworld Abe's Exodus was my favorite! I played it when i was about 6 years old and that was when i learned that getting through the game doesn't mean you beat it lmao didnt save enough Mudokon buddies until my teenage years üòÖ
U.S.A. California

We always played Oddworld Abe‚Äôs Odyssey on our PS1 as kids. I remember inviting friends over just to play it; they thought it was dumb at first, but I eventually got most of Them to buy their own copies! I‚Äôm from the United States, Connecticut specifically.

I'm gonna say Munch, only because I have the most memories of playing that with my brother as a kid, who passed away in August. But I love all the games (even have an Oddworld Inhabitants tattoo.)
I'm in North America.

The original Oddworld games are my favorite, but if I had to pick one, it‚Äôd be Oddworld: Abe‚Äôs Edoddus. The implementation of ‚ÄúAll‚Äôa ya!‚Äù was extremely HELPFUL! I played all the Oddworld games with my brother and late father so they hold a very very special place in my heart.
I‚Äôm in North America ‚Äî Northern California!

Strangers wrath upped my expectations of what a game could be. You thought the game was over the story was only halfway done. masterpiece.

Odd world Abe‚Äôs Odysee was one of the first games I owned on PlayStation. (THPS was the other) Odysee will always be one of my top 5 games of all time! I always wanted to try a scrab cake! I cannot wait for soul storm. It will be one of the few games that I pre order The delux edition

California United States

I loved Abe's Odyssey. My dad and I would play it all the time when we got it for PS1. When I seen Abe become the Shryskull, i lost my year old mind! Still one of my favorite moments of Oddworld.
North America

My favorite has to be Exoddus! Ive played em all save for Stranger, and have definitely poured hundreds of hours into Exoddus. I got really good at it from a pretty young age. Not willing to cheat, I ran through the game several times trying to save em all, but never quite succeeded! I would hear of people going well beyond the 300, and I was suprised.
That game shaped so many of my interests. A staple in my personal development :)

Strangers Wrath quite simply defined my gaming experience as a teenager. My family and I were (and are) long-term fans of all things Oddworld, but Strangers Wrath offered a new, quirky (and downright addictive!) form of gameplay that kept me hooked for hours on end. I have many fond memories of playing Strangers Wrath at my Dad‚Äôs house; my good aim being one of the things that nabbed me the title of ‚Äúnumber one son‚Äù (much to the chagrin of my only sibling, my older brother üòÇ).

Region = UK

Strangers wrath has always been my fav. But ive played four in the series

Michigan US

My favorite is the original, Abe's Odyssey. Brings me back to my childhood when my brother and I would play.

Munch's Oddysee is my first and favorite game in the series. It's still so much fun to play even after all these years.
USA

Abe's odyssey was my favorite. Can't beat the classic.

US

I have played almost every oddworld game and still own most on steam and xbox. However while I love all of them I prefer strangers wrath the most as it reminds me of the spaghetti westerns I used to watch with my grandfather.

I played new and tasty a few years ago and it blew me away one of my top ten games of all time I then went and played the others. But new and tasty is my favorite. I'm from the UK

The original Oddyssey for PS1. I remember racing my brother and my friend who were playing at the same time at his house. I beat it and got the good ending. I jumped in the car and rushed over just as they were ending the the game. They got the bad ending and I laughed so hard.

Abe‚Äôs Exodus is my favorite Oddworld game. Odyssey was the first video game that made me realize games were always going to be a part of my life, but Exodus expanded on Odyssey in all the right ways. I hope you guys and gals are always a part of the games industry. Keep killin‚Äô it!! My name is Rodney Finney and I‚Äôm writing from Woodstock, Georgia in the US. Good luck to all!!

Soulstorm looks like it's going to be amazing, remember playing Abe's oddyssee at a really young age, it was a great game, also loved munch's oddyssee was amazing as well but playing new and tasty and reliving the old memories in HD was a dream come true and will be my favourite of the series. At leadt for now

Wales/Europe

My favorite was definitely Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus. It improved on every aspect of the previous game, especially the save game feature.

USA.

I played so many hours to Oddworld: Abe's Odyssey with my brother as a child... So much memories!

Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath is my all-time favorite Oddworld game! Sadly, I don't have a Switch to play it on.:( So a Stranger's Wrath-themed Switch would be more than perfect for me! Hope I'm lucky enough to win!:D

Region: United States

Oddworld Abes Oddysee and Exodus, came out the year and the year after I was born, by the time I was old enough to play them I played none stop. 23 years later and they‚Äôre still in my collection. I keep a PS2 specifically for these 2 games and I continue to plat them a few times each year. As well as New n Tasty which I have frequently played on both PS4 and IOS. Quite simply the greatest games ever made ! The imagery and sound alone put it leagues above even games of the current console generation!.
Region: United Kingdom

My favorite game is Oddworld: Abe‚Äôs Oddysee
I had such a blast playing that game over and over again. It taught me that farting whenever and wherever is except-able.. Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you otherwise!
(Region: United States, NJ)

Love me some strangers wrath. And Codes for Europe would be lovely :)

Abe's Oddysee is such a classic, it will always be my favorite. All of the games that came frome Oddworld were great. North America

My first time was Abe‚Äôs exodus on the ps1 my uncle handed me the controller and then it just stuck my favorite though is strangers wrath I have played it on 4 different systems original Xbox ps3 PS4 and switch

United States/Texas

My favorite was Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus. It really expanded on and refined everything that made the first one great, and I actually remember bringing it home with Ocarina of Time that week, but wanting to play and finish Oddworld first. That's how much I enjoyed the first one, and cinematic puzzle platformer has always been one of my favorite subgenres. They nailed it.

Region: North America

My favorite was abes odyssey. I live in anchorage alaska usa

My favorite is Stranger's Wrath. An FPS in the OW universe? Sign me up. Been a big fan since the original on OG Xbox

my favorite is Oddworld: abe's exoddus

Ah this is so crazy! Strangers Wrath is my favorite by far. Me and my older brother played Strangers Wrath together soon after initial release. We took turns and had so much fun playing together. A memory I think of every so often. Funny enough I had bought the iOS version when it came out, and I thought about it yesterday and downloaded it on my sons iPad so he could experience this wonderful gem! And then I see this. What are the ODDS?! ^,~ This Switch remodel looks so good! Good luck everyone! Even if you don‚Äôt win, find a way to play it if you haven‚Äôt. Instant classic!

North America

My favorite Oddworld is actually the first one I played: Munch's Oddysee. The reason it's my favorite is I actually played it at my aunt's house, and we each played one of the characters. I was Munch, she was Abe. We only ever got abiut halfway yhrough, because we weren't smart enough to solve the puzzles lol. But we still enjoyed playing it this way whenever I stayed at her house.

WI, USA, by the way

Much was mine first one. Love going to my step-mom house to play it on the xbox. Till i got my own Xbox and it was my first game. That Christmas i open the game up first then the xbox.

First game on PS1 was one of my earliest memories of gaming watching my father play it. Was glad to play it myself when the remaster released for PS4. Excited for the new PS5 entry.

Oddworld Abes Oddysee on the ps1 was my earliest gaming memory :) loved new and tasty aswell!! Hoping soil storm comes to switch aswell! I‚Äôm from the Uk/Europe :)

Strangers Wrath on the original Xbox was my absolute favorite. Something about the fact that your scavenge for your own ammo and can use any combination of ammo to tackle a big fight. It makes for a lot of replayability! I'm in North America

To this day my brother's and I still summon each other with \"Hello. Hello. Follow me. Okay.\" Been a fan since the very first game on the very first PlayStation!!!

Strangers Wrath

North America

To many, i played a lot of Oddworld Abes oddysee on PC and Strangers Wrath on my Xbox. And offcourse the remake on my Xbox one. I really hope it wouldnt take that long for you guys to bring the new one to series X. But if i win ik could already play it on the Switch
Europe/Netherlands

Definitely the original Abe's Oddysee on PS One I couldn't tell you how many times I played that growing up

North America

Oddworld Abe‚Äôs odyssee back on PS1 was my first entry in the franchise and it just felt so unique and different from everything I was playing at the time. It struck a chord instantly with me and, call it nostalgia or not it has been my favorite since. And my region is NA (North America) but like many I‚Äôve got multiple diff nationality accounts to enjoy the foreign eshops discounts

Strangers wrath of course! Played all the time on original xbox. North America!

I've been playing the Oddworld series forever. Ever since I was a kid. Anytime I play my 'New 'N' Tasty' I get such nostalgia from it. I love the series and all the games in it! Hard to say which is my favorite of all of them, they're all so good! But I would probably have to say Stranger's Wraith was my favorite. It took such a different approach from the series and all other games in general. It's definitely the most unique take for Oddworld. I love them! Everything they do is great and I'm looking forward to Soulstorm! I'm a huge fan!!!

North America
Texas

Stranger's Wrath is one of my favorite games of all time. Aside from the fun, dusty western aesthetics meshed with goofy aliens, I just admire how ambitious it was. The first person/3rd person mechanic is fun and helps create a great mesh between exploration and combat, and having ammo be critters that you stun and pick up is just so fun while also making it more believable whenever you find ammo just lying around, cause it lives there. And on top of that, Stranger is such a cool character with an amazing design. I just love the whole thing so much.

Don't really have a favorite since the whole franchise is pretty awesome. Out of all of them I played stranger's wrath the most. Just the idea of the wanted becoming a bounty hunter and back to being wanted at the end just sounds like a unique idea.
***North America***

The first Oddworld game Abe's Oddysee still stands as the best for its overall dark and industrial tone before the series became too fixated on nonsense humour. Glockstars... just, why?

Region: Europe

Abe's Odyssey - what started this legendary franchise. Sure the sequels did a good ob, but for me, the first one the most memorable!
Europe, Hungary

Odd world abes odyssey UK. I remember my dad gifting this to me for Christmas. One of the best ps1 games of my childhood spent hours in the chat menu

Abes Exodus!

Strangers wrath has an awesome world to explore. But abes oddysee is my favorite (north America)

It's gotta be the original for me, learning the concept of such a different concept for a game for the first time was a great memory - AUS

I absolutely loved Abes Oddysee I remember playing with my younger brother on the ps1 all the time all the found memories of my childhood have been around many of the odd world games and I've enjoyed them so much but something about hearing that ps1 load up and going into that intro just has always had me hooked to it as my favorite.

From the United states

I would have to say Stranger's Wrath is my favorite Oddworld game. I love the story & gameplay is so fun.

Oddworld: Stranger‚Äôs Wrath is one of my favorite games ever. First played it on Xbox and I had the time of my life with it on PS Vita.
Pal region. Europe / Greece.

I cant get enough of anything Oddworld! My favorite will always be Abe's Exoddus. I would always get the chance to play through it at my uncle's house. I remember getting myself stuck trying to beat the clock and escape the factory. A flying slig was right on me and i panic quick saved EXACTLY when it was throwing a bomb at me... i had to reload that spot maybe 30 times before i was finally able to roll out of harms way to freedom!

Edit for region: United States of America Louisiana

Abes odeysess and munchiea odeysess is my favorite. Hoping to get it for ps4 when I have the funds . hope I win USA here.

My favorite Oddworld game has always been the original Abe‚Äôs Oddysee. Such a fantastic introduction to an incredible world. My brother and I would play for hours on the original PlayStation.

USA

Stranger Wrath because I had it on GameCube as a kid and loved it! UK

Abe's Exodus! United States

I think Munches Odyssey is my favorite Oddworld game. I've been a fan since the beginning, and love them all, but Munch blew me away. I loved the little fuzzles, and how they are actually rabid haha. But I really enjoyed the puzzles, and tag teaming with Abe. I'm still playing it today. USA

I loved playing Abe‚Äôs Oddysee so, when I saw that is was being remastered as New ‚ÄòN Tasty I had to pick it up and got to relive some great memories.

United States here!

North America - Boston
I used to work for the company \"Soulstorm Brewery\" back then, the hours were terrible, working conditions were sub-par at best, and management WHOO BOY. I quit just before the big building went down, there were talks on the working floor going about some \"messiah\" coming to shut the place down and burn it to the ground. I got out of there as fast as I could. Somehow, I still feel lucky about the whole ordeal. Makes for one Hell of an Entry on my Resume. -TerroS Kid

I loved playing Stranger's Wrath on my original Xbox. Never got to finish it, but what I did play was soooo fun.

US

My parents had bought me Abe's Odyssey aay back when for my PS1 and it was my absolute favorite. I cant even count how many times I replayed through it.

I love all the games but the original Oddworld will always hold a special place in my heart, it was the most interesting game I'd played in a long time! On my original PlayStation!! Love them all though, enough to re-buy them on PC when I could lol. I'm in North America: Nebraska.

Abe‚Äôs Exoddus has been my favorite game for as long as I can remember. It had so much to do with how many levels were added.

I loved Stranger's Wrath on the original Xbox. I never owned a Playstation to play the other games. Always wanted to try Munchie's Odyssey but never got the chance. I've been wanting to get Stranger's Wrath again though. The puns in the game were pure comic joy.

North America.

USA - Ohio

I remember there was a surge of advertising that caught my eye when Exodus came out. Instant addiction for my then twelve year old brain. I was then shocked to learn that this was the second in the series, so naturally my head exploded. Exodus will always be my go to, but every installment like Munch and Stranger has been welcomed like old family.

Abes Exodus was awesome. So many ways to express my frustration through Abe. Growls, Meows, Farts, and Mystic Chants! These match my moods perfectly. Does anyone remember the \"Use Your Imagination\" music video for Munche's Odyssey?

USA/Oregon

Abe's Oddysee and Exoddus ^_^ New 'n Tasty is good too.
But not really into Munch's Oddysee and Stranger's Wrath, feels a bit...Odd... :D

Hungary (Europe)

My favorite is Munch‚Äôs Oddysee. Came out when I was a kid and I spent so much time playing it. First Oddworld game and first Xbox game I played.
My region is North America/United States/Georgia

Abe's Exoddus for sure. Can't wait for Soulstorm! (I'm in the US)

Favourite has to be Exoddus. Remember getting it for Christmas so excited after playing Oddysee. Just so jam packed and within 9 months of development, it was amazingly made. Certainly twice the flavour, indeed.
Europe, here. UK specifically.

I've played every odd world game I could get my hands on but somehow strangers wrath has stuck with me through the years. I still think about that game out of the blue from time to time. I'm so glad the odd world inhabitants back

United states

Munches oddessy favourite because it was my first experience with the oddworld franchise and ever since I've been craving more and more! The series is made for the switch in my opinion. UK

The original oddysey. Got a thrashed up copy at a rummage sale at a church and instantly fell in love my first time getting pulped. There was a scratch that kept me from seeing the cutscenes after falling off a cliff, but password helped me out there.

I'm in NA.

New and Tasty is the way to go, I remember randomly playing it in my childhood and that's one of the games that really got me into gaming.

Region: North America

Always loved the Oddworld games since my parents played them and my brother's and I watched, but I think my favorite one is Abe's Exodus. Being so extended and all of the weird mechanics (I'll never forget possesed farts) and enemies, it just made it feel so alive.

USA

Oddworld Abe's Oddysee is where my journey with the franchise began, and it's always held a special place in my heart. The series is a couple years older than me but it's held it's grip tight and I'm never gonna let it go. I buy every release that comes out of each game, and I even have a tattoo planned out! Oddworld has been my life and has even influenced partially what my current career path is and my college degree that in pursuing. (I run a video game store and attend college for graphic design). I hope Oddworld will always remain a big part of my life, like it has the past 21 years I've been around.

Shout-out from the United States!

My favorite Oddworld game would have to Abe's Oddysee~ a Playstation classic!! I remember first encountering the game and being frightened by how dark the game was~ and felt real bad about Mudokens being treated so harshly in rupture farms. But then later, discovering that it is my mission as Abe, to escape and rescue my friend's for this horror place! I was astounded!! Such a mission given to me, the player! I'll never forget the beautiful background from visiting different stage's, with it's beautiful colors from blue's and the orange evening. How unique each alien was~ from the mischievous Paramites, which as first, seemed adorable when lonesome, but if he meets a friend!! Oh boy, scary vicious lil fellah!!! Ahh I can hear his screeching in my head~!! The Scrabs, chasing you down, and while the same time, the music changes~ and it just gets your blood pumping!! Goly, the music for the game was truly astounding~‚òÜ What a game!!! That's why Oddworld will always be one of those rare game's, that will shine, regardless the years that go by~‚òÜ And I'm very honored to have played it!

Region: United States of America

My favourite was Munch's Oddysee, the first oddworld game I played. I loved the soundtrack, and how alien and weird everything was. The big bro sligs were so cool to my child mind and I was blown away by the puzzles and open world gameplay at the time. It was my gateway to a franchise I now cherish, but Munch's odysse will always be my favourite of the series.

Oh man, growing up Stranger's Wrath was my jam! Recently replayed it on PC, such a creative shooter game. Bolamites FTW!

California, Chico specifically :)

The original Abe‚Äôs Odyssey on the PlayStation was the very first game I ever bought with my own money. I have so many great memories of playing that incredibly fun and challenging game.

Abe's Odyssey will always be my favourite.

I remember playing it when i was very young with my parents on our old PS1, and loving the puzzles, enviroments and various enemies. Made me fall in love with Oddworld and i've never looked back! :D

Europe here. Good luck to you all :)

I remember years ago my dad coming home with Abe's oddysee back on the ps1. Game left many memories

Oddworld: Abe Exoddus - I know it wasn't straight sequel, but I am impressed how they've expanded mythology. The thing I love about Oddworld games is that every one feels different, yet the quality remains.

USA

Stranger's Wrath for sure. So many hours spent throughout my childhood completing the game several times on the Xbox and then again on PC as an adult. An amazing little world and a great game, would love to make it my first owned on the Switch.

Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus is my favorite!! :)

I really loved the first game on the first Playstation, the first part of the game had an atmosphere really cool on the factory and during the escape but never could finish it.
but I really lover the strangers wrath, the main character was a baddass and the different type of amnutions was really fun, to see the different kind of reactions was funny. I really liked the western atmosphere and the bounty
damn I would love to have this switch, it would be like a trophy on my living room haha ^^

Stranger's Wrath.

Back in 2004, my mom used to work for a gaming company and, after going to a gaming convention, brought home a pre-order demo disc of Stranger's Wrath with gameplay footage of the game and a collection of all the cutscenes from the earlier Oddworld games. On top of that, she even got an artbook detailing \"The First Ten Years\" of Oddworld Inhabitants, which I still have. I never owned an Xbox as a kid, but was so eager to play it after watching through the demo disc many times. I've only ever gotten to play it once or twice on the original Xbox at a friend's, but copped the HD version on PC just years later and finally played through it. Needless to say, it was well worth it.

Looking forward to Abe's new adventure as well!

I found Abe's Odyssee when I was young and it inspired my mind to new creative places. It seemed at the time a lot of media was moving toward a more realistic place. To find something so original both in setting and in game play blew my mind.

Stranger's Wrath is my favourite oddworld. Because it is my first oddworld game i ever played

My first Oddworld game was a Greatest Hits version of Abe's Oddysee. I loved it so much I wrote an essay about it for my English class in school, and my email I use is still a reference to it, 20 years later.

I love Abe's Exoddus! The graphics are timeless and the story is nice! Also I like the bigger outcome compared with Abe's Oddysee!

I'm from Europe!

Munch‚Äôs Oddysee is definitely my favorite game in the series! It was one of the first games I played all the way through as a kid without any help üòÅ It would be so cool to win the Switch and get to replay the game on a modern console!

North America

Nothing compares to the first time playing Oddworld: Abe's Odyssey. I played it on the original Playstation. Still one of my favorite games to this day. *Follow me*Follow me*Follow me*Follow me*

Oddworld: Abe‚Äôs Exoddus is my favorite one. First I didn‚Äôt have access to the big games as a child that would take a lot out of a computer but, games that didn‚Äôt require that much power were all game. I knew of the Oddworld series but, never had access until I saw it for PC cheap on Amazon. After convincing my mom I got it and once I got it I fell in love with it having to save Mudokons and learning of the history of the Necrum Mines and the Soulstorm Brew.I would even look at the history of how the game is made and learning that this game took only 9 months still amazes me for the dedication of the Oddworld team and my inspiration to game design. And now with Oddworld: Soulstorm coming out and me being a fully grown adult I look forward to see what the game was meant to be like and gain the experience I did as a child again.

North America üòå

I‚Äôve played all of the Oddworld games but Abe's Oddysee my first and favorite . I was 8 years old and would draw scrabs and sligs on the backs of all of my assignments at school. North America.

Munches oddysee was the first video game I played through! I was mortified as a kid when I got the bad ending

NH, United States

Definitely Strangers Wrath! North America :)

My favorite game in the franchise is definitely Oddworld: Munch‚Äôs Oddysee! I love the characters and overall feel of the game. It was one of my favorite games growing up, and now with it being on the Switch, I would love you relive all of my nostalgic memories üòÅ

I am from North America, thankfully! It would be awesome to win the Switch and to get to replay updated versions of games from one of my favorite franchises!

Abe's Odyssey, Europe.

Abe's Oddysee of course!
Russia

Abe's Odyssey, spent way to many hours on that game, Scotland/Europe.

My favorite Oddworld game Abe‚Äôs Oddysee because of the tone and aesthetic. A lot of games from the late 90s theming corporate corruption/greed and environmentalism, but the villains at Rapture Farms was in a league of its own. Abe being a goofy looking and clumsy protagonist, yet succeeding in such a difficult and noble endeavor, as freeing his people and saving his home, was an experience I‚Äôve not forgotten since I was kid. Thanks for the great games, Oddworld!

North America

Oddworld Abe's Oddysey was always my favourite, I remember when it came out as a kid. I saved up for ages to be able to buy it and I would play it with my sister for ages. It's one of the very few games I could enjoy with my sibling since we had such different tastes in games.

Sweden / Europe

Abe's Odyssey is still one of my favorite games of all time. North America

Got to be the first one on the original PlayStation. I'd never seen anything like it, it was so creative, the CG was movie-level, and controlling the sligs was so fun. I even tried to make my own Elum doll (it turned out badly lol). I thought the second Game Boy game was pretty good too. Region: USA

Abe's exodus is definitely my favorite of all. It has a special place in my heart for it is the only game i could get my dad to play with me back in the day. I think it was the artistic style of the world and the characters that hooked him in, just like me. America, ohio

This is so cool!! I've been playing the oddworld series since I could pick up a controller. My favorite will always be Abe's Oddysee (it's also my favorite game of all time). It's such a revolutionary game and the graphics are still pretty good even by today's standards. The game speak still blows my mind to this day. My family loved playing these games together and Abe's Oddysee is one of the first games I show people when I meet them. I love all the games but definitely Abe's Oddysee is my favorite. (US resident)

Munch's Oddysee on Xbox is my favorite. First Oddworld game I played and I loved it. I wish the newer ones were in that style instead of the old school sidescroller, but I know I'm in the minority there.

USA, MS

My favorite game is munch‚Äôs Oddysee! It was actually the first game I ever picked out for myself as a kid. I‚Äôve replayed it so many times!
I‚Äôm from North america!

Oddworld Abes Exoddus is my favorite. North America region

My favourite game has to be the original Abe's oddysee!

My favorite Oddworld was Abe's Odysee
I just really enjoyed the feeling of survive on that uncharted world.
The game balances its action and puzzle elements perfectly

Brazil / South America

Oddworld Strangers Wrath is my favorite Oddworld game, it has an amazing Story Twist.

I've been playing Oddworld since the original when I was 4, the game was just so fun that I've been playing it for almost 23 years. North America.

My favourite Oddworld game is without shadow of doubt Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus. It was like Oddysee but much more complete! (Region: Europe)

For me, Strangers Wrath is my absolute favorite. It blends 3D platforming and first person shooting together wonderfully. The atmosphere and setting are phenomenal. I've bought the game across 4 different platforms because it deserves all the support. I hope the winners of the console and the codes enjoy it because it's simply a must play!!!

Strangers Wrath is my favorite

Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus, best game ever. Europe.

Strangers wrath is the best one of all time!

I remember my sister and I sinking days into strangers wrath on the original Xbox. That twist was gorgeous!
North America

Oddworld: Munch‚Äôs Oddysee, NA region, please and thank you. :D

My fave oddworld game is munch Odyssey I like that they were willing to take a risk and go with a 3d formula instead of 2d ( also Because nostalgia) for the game
North America

My favourite Oddworld Game is the original Abe's Oddysee for PS1! I remember playing it and really struggling as a child to beat it, but I was really in love with the message and themes of freedom and comments about society it had, even as a child. It was so nice being able to revisit this game in New 'n' Tasty, and although I can't enter for the Switch system which absolutely guts me! I'd die to be part of the giveaway.

P.S Please reconsider the Switch system for Europe! It's so beautiful!

Oddworld Munches Oddysee was not only the my first Oddworld game,but the very first game I bought with my own money! I was in love with by the cover art and the gameplay hooked me! Quickly started finding the old Gameboy games and ps1 games and dived right into the Oddworld! Already pre-ordered my physical copy of limited edition Munches Oddysee,can't wait for soulstorm!

United States btw :)

My favorite Oddworld Game is Abe's Oddysee. It was one of the first games that really challenged me as a child.
Philadelphia, Pa. USA

My favourite is Abe's Oddysee I was about 18 at the time it came out. I loved the style of game from things like flashback. However, Oddworld just had the story, the control, the visuals, sound design and the heart to discuss real world issues within an engaging world.
America

Munch‚Äôs Oydssey was a incredible sequel to the Oddworld story in my opinion and the first game I bought when I finally got an Xbox as a child. Lifelong fan. Hard to pick a favorite.

I introduced Abe's Odyssey to my toddler son
on the original Playstation 20 years ago. He is getting his masters in Physics now and still plays all the games! Abe's Exodous, Stranger's Wrath, New and Tasty and Munch's Odyssey and we are both so excited for the new Soulstorm coming out next!
North America, Texas

Abe's Oddysee has stayed my favorite in the series. The others are great, but Oddysee is such a classic. The atmosphere was so perfectly nailed and really adds to the immersion of the game.
Region is USA.

Love the first two, Abe's Odyssey and Exodus. My GF at the time and I lost days to those games. Oregon, USA

Abe's Exoddus was my favorite of the series! I can't wait to see what Soul Storm will bring though! (From OK, USA)

The original Abe‚Äôs Odyssey is defiantly my favorite, it‚Äôs just so dark and creepy!
My region is North America

North America. Houston, Texas.

My favorite Oddworld game was and still is Munch's Odyssee. When I was about 8 years old I remember going to Toys R Us with my mom and her suprising me with an Xbox. And the game she bought with it was Munch's Odyssee. Ever since playing that game growing up it has always,to this day, had a special place in my heart. It's even influenced me in some way to go forward and receive my Enviornmental Scince degrees. The message in this game, and the entire series, is one that will always stick with me through life.

Oddworld New 'n' tasty got me through a long stint in hospital a while back. It will always hold a special place in my heart.

Europe, UK

My favorite is Abe's Oddysee, it's kind of our family game.
North America, Texas.

Oddworld New N Tasty is my favorite of the Oddworld games because it marked the grand return of Oddworld Inc. I've been rooting for Mr. Lanning and crew for as long as I can remember, so seeing them rise again made my heart happy. And having a physical Vita release puts my favorite console and my favorite dev in the same place!

Even though I have a strong love for the original Oddysee, I found myself coming back to Stranger‚Äôs Wrath more and more. It was a deviation to the gameplay and I loved the Western/Bounty Hunter feel to the whole look and story. NA Region/USA

Oddworld: New n' Tasty is my favourite. It took the great story of Abe's Oddysee and improved everything about it.

My favorite is the OG Abe's Oddysee. Such good times being sat down with my old man, we really bonded. Back in '97 my folks scraped together what they had to get me the PS1 value pack and FF7..

AO was the first full-price game I bought on the PS1 with my allowance. I knew it was my bag from the moment I saw it, and I've been a fan ever since!

Florida, USA

I played Oddworld Abe‚Äôs Oddysee with my dad when I was growing up on PC. It was the first real video game I ever played. My dad would control the arrow buttons and I would hold shift or hit space to run or jump when we needed to. We would work through the levels together throwing out ideas until we solved the puzzle.
Still the best game series to this day in my opinion.
United States, North America, NTSC

Abe's Exoddus for me. One of my favorite games of all time. I can still hear \"follow me\" in my head. North America / US / NJ

I've played Munch's Oddysee since I was super young and it still holds a special place in my heart. I then heard that there are OTHER Oddworld games that are supposedly even better, so I tried my hand at New n Tasty and absolutely loved it. Can't wait for Soulstorm too.
Tennessee, USA

My fav will always be Abe's Oddysee. I remember getting the game as a kid in a big box from a local toy store (they didn't have dedicated game stores back then) with my uncle. He initially thought the game looked too violent and was worried my mum wouldn't let me play. After some time i convinced him and i played the first few times with the door closed so my mum didn't see.

Had terrible nightmares ROFL.

Finished the game a couple years later but didn't understand why my guy Abe always died in the end. Think i was 10 at the time! Still have fond memories to this day when i beat it with all the mudokons released.

Europe here!

Abe's Oddysee! always loved the pre-rendered graphics and the unique, gritty art style and tone - haven't played the others yet but I'd love the chance to. AU/NZ here c:

the only one I've tried was New 'N Tasty on the Wii U, but I would like to give it Stranger's Wrath a try.

North America (Canada)

my very first game when I bought my very first gaming system was Abe's Oddysee for PSX. It has deep influence in me as a gamer -- so much that I have the Scrab and Paramite tattoos on my arms.

Michigan, USA.

Favourite one for sure is Abe‚Äôs Oddysee my brother and I played a lot together on ps1. From NA

Loved the first 2 Abe games and Munch.

Region 1
Colorado USA

It's tough, but I have to say Stranger's Wrath. The plot about a bounty hunter with a secret and then saving some native folks' water supply is great.

My favourite is easily the first one. There was something magical about those first steps into the unique world of, well, oddities. I still find myself thinking about the fart+giggle combo every now and again to be honest.

Europe, btw :)

I Borrowed my Xbox back in march of 2005 After using my birthday money to buy Strangers Wrath for A console i didnt have Just so i could play this epic third person Shooter~! Loved and got so mad at this game and fell in love with again. Esrb NA please if im lucky

Stranger's Wrath is perhaps my favorite game of allll time. Across 4 different platforms I have bought it at least 6 times. I have created homages to the characters, world, and technology of all of the Oddworld games in my own fiction and roleplaying experiences. This is perhaps one of the greatest things I have ever seen. Oddworld is as far as I'm concerned the perfect franchise and the fact that this switch exists is making me lose all my stuff's. All of it. Even thing I have not yet eaten and turned into stuff's I have lost.

I am in the United States, in Utah.

And I'm going to stop myself before I give my home address, blood type and medical history. Cause I'm excited.

I feel your excitement. Me too. If i don't win it hopefully you do.

oddworld strangers wrath was my favorite. im in the usa. i hope i win. this system will look sick af on my mantle. thx

I have a soft spot for adventures on the gameboy it was the first one I played when I was kid because I didn‚Äôt have a PlayStation and I always thought oddworld looked so cool. United States here

Oh my God, I love Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath, I remember it was one of the reasons I bought an Xbox, because I had played Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee and Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus on PCs in the 90s.

Sensational, congratulations to those involved.

I'm from Utah/US

My favorite Oddworld game is Abe's Exoddus. It's the first game I remember playing, it's my favorite game in general and it has the best soundtrack.
North America, Texas

Strangers wrath or new n tasty been playing this series since I was 5 in 2005 would love this üò≠

Def Abe's Exodus! North America

Odd World: Stranger's Wrath looks the best to me, but I must confess that I've never played any of the Odd World games. I would say my region is a bit of an odd world itself though, USA!

Oddworld New n Tasty was a blast on Xbox!
Haven't played Strangers Wrath yet...
Europe/The Netherlands

Abe's Oddysee was the first game I got for the ps1. I was ten years old and immediately fell in love with all games oddworld. I would take strategy guides to school to show off the game to my friends. And any time i got around a computer with internet i would log into the website and just look up anything i could find about Oddworld. Truly my favorite game and I'm no stranger to Oddworld and would love that special edition switch more than i can say. North America United States

New n Tasty is really great :)

Europe \\m/

Favorite Oddworld game is Strangers Wrath. I loved it on Xbox when it was first released and enjoyed it again on Vita. Would love to play it again on Switch. I‚Äôm NA please and thanks for the chance.

My favorite was Munches Oddessey. The transition from side scrolling to a 3d platfomer blew me away.
USA region here

I have to say the og odd world Abe‚Äôs odyssey was by far one of my favorite games growing up it taught me a lot one of the first games that was truly challenging and the story wow can‚Äôt believe you guys are making games again it has me so excited for the future of video games for odd world inhabitants!

US REGION

My favorite Oddworld game is Abe's Oddysee. Though I love all of the Oddworld game, including the little Gameboy ports no body talks about, Abe's Oddysee was my first experience with the Oddworld universe, which has shaped a lot of my early life.

Windsor, Ontario. Canada.

I haven't had the chance to play some of them but I have to say my favorite one is the original Abe's Oddysee/New 'N Tasty. Just what set the game universe off for me and made me want more. When New 'N Tasty game out I immediately bought it and enjoyed all the nostalgia as well as the new trophies to obtain. Having the dlc for it was just an added bonus.

Abe's Odyssey was too hard for me growing up, so I watched my neighbor friend beat most of it. One of my standout playstation memories.

Abbes odyssey, spent forever and a day trying to beat it when I was young. NA region.

Oddworld abe exodus fue el que m√°s me gusto tanto su ambientaci√≥n como sus personajes bizzaros tambien fue el primer juego de game boy que jugu√© mexicano/america

Strangers Wrath is an exceedingly clever game. Cannot complain about a game where the ammo for your gun is a living creature.

North America what's up.

My favorite Oddworld game is Stranger's Wrath.
Region: North Amercia

I'll always love the original. It was so goofy and quirky that the rest, despite being great games, kind of fail to bring the same lame feel.

Also, US Region though not living in the US at the moment. Take that as you will Nintendo Everything.

OddWorld Abe‚Äôs oddysee was my favorite played it like crazy back on the ps1 loved oddworld new n tasty as well played that a lot too but the original has always been my favorite use to spend hours on that game. I just finished playing through strangers wrath and loved it

I've always loved Abe' Exxoddus on the original PSX. Region: USA

I enjoyed Stranger's Wrath the most! NA

Stranger's Wrath is definitely my favorite Oddworld game, one of the most creative first-person shooters that I've played and I enjoyed the story quite a bit. I'm in North America, more specifically the United States (Midwest).

My favorite Oddworld game is Stranger's Wrath. I while I do enjoy New N' Tasty, I feel that the action genre of SW is much better for me.
US.

My favorite old world game is stranger's wrath, I originally bought it on the first Xbox and have since bought it on android as well. Would love to have it for Switch. My region is North America.

Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath - North America! ^_^

I have to say the Original is still one of the best for me and maybe YouYouYouYouYou...ahem. Also Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath was utterly brilliant so much I bought it twice.

The first game because it started it all. Loved Oddworld Inhabitants stories and art ever since.

The only one I've played to completion is Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee, so I guess that's ones my favorite. I think I also played Munch's Oddysee, but not for long because my Xbox was having issues. My region is USA.

My favorite would be \"New N Tasty\" (Wii U version), but it may be because is the only one I've played . =P

America/ Mexico.

I played Oddworld Adventures when I was young on gameboy color and was so surprised to find out it was a much bigger franchise when I got older, and that the two adventure games were retellings of the original playstation games. Realizing how much this series meant to me as a child, I've dived deep into the series more with it's HD remakes thanks to limited run, as well as new n' tasty on ps3. My favorite game is absolutely Stranger's Wrath! A game I feel absolutely deserves a sequel at some point. Looking Forward to Soulstorm's release greatly as well!

My favourite Oddworld Game is Munch‚Äôs Odyssey. It was the first game I bought for my OG Xbox after I completed Halo at launch :)

ODDWORLD: Abe's Oddysee.
I remember sitting down notebook pen in hand and playing it over and over again. I do have a soft spot for Munches oddysee too.

Abe's Oddysee, first one I remember playing. USA here!

Stranger‚Äôs Wrath! North America üòÅ

My favorite Oddworld game will always be Oddworld Abe's Xoddus, and even though it was an older game I still play to this day
North American region

Oddworld: Abe‚Äôs Oddysee

The second game Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus, the first one was good and I loved the possession mechanic, but the sequel made it even better by allowing Abe to posses the fauna.

North America account, I'll take the code if I get it.

Oddworld Stranger‚Äôs Wrath HD with gyro aiming for its mixed perspectives, which was crucial addition that really made the game more fun. Especially on a handheld system.

USA!

Btw that furry dock is so legit lol

My first and favourite Oddworld Game is Abe‚Äôs Oddysee. I got it for my 12th Birthday in 1999 after seeing \"Music Instructor feat. Abe ‚Äì Get freaky\" on Television. I found out that it's a Videogame Character and i wanted the Game. As a kid it was just a fun Game but as i grew older and replayed it over a dozen times i understood more and more about this Game. Under its easy to understand Gameplay is so much value. It made me think about life, consuming meat and friendship. As a lifelong fan of this Series i would be absolute over the Moon to own a Lorne Lanning signed Oddworld Switch.

Europe

Oddworld Munch‚Äôs Oddysee was my favorite...it was so much fun to switch between the characters, and the graphics and sound were great on the original Xbox.

I live in the United States of America

i quite like Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee
(UK)

Abe's odyssey from back in the day! Europe here!

I've only played the first two, and Abe's Exodus was the first I played (when it came out), which is probably why it's my favorite.

I played Oddysee decades after release, it's probably just as good but I gotta go with Exodus as my fave.

North America, USA

Easy, Abe‚Äôs Oddysee top 10 best games of all time played it when i was a wee little lad.

It's hard to pick a favorite as the entire oddworld saga has been amazing but I did absolutely love strangers wrath! North America here!!

I might be the only one but my favorite Oddworld game is Munch's Oddysee for the Game Boy Advance. Anyone else have fond memories of this game? :)

Region:USA

Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee - It was so weird and interesting for its time. Not many puzzle/platformer combos back then. Not to mention the strange artstyle that was so captivating the first time you saw it in a gaming magazine. Region: USA / North America

Stranger's Wrath is actually my favorite title in this franchise.

And I'm so excited that it's now on Switch.
A great title to have on the go.

I remember playing this on the original Xbox when it released. Good times.

P. S. July 18th is my birthday!
Just saying. *wink* *wink*

North America region

Oddworld munch's oddysee I used to love the advert on tv that's what made me get the game.

oddworld abe's oddysee on the ps1, still one of my fave games ever!

Strangers Wrath was one of the most inventive games of its time. NA

Stranger‚Äôs Wrath is definitely a favorite.
[North America]

Abes odyssey is the besttt! Played a bunch of it before moving to Nintendo (after being a PS fanboi) and being out of the series for awhile Live in the USA :)

I've never played an Oddworld game. But I've seen the titles flow in & out of my recommended videos while in YouTube, and I've looked at the eShop listings a few times. I've been curious about the series & perhaps this contest is the push I could use to really explore these games!

(P.S. That dock is simultaneously amazing & creepy. I don't know if I'd ever use it, just because it might startle me when I see it.)

I'm in the US!

Oddworld Munch's Oddysee on Xbox as it's the only one I've played. Region: North America

My favorite is the Original Oddworld the story, setting, and gameplay was so unique for its time. The gameplay itself made the game challenging yet simple to master and the dark humor was a joy to experience. I've never gotten to play Strangers wrath but from what I've seen it looks great. I'm from North America.

My favorite is Oddworld New N Tasty. I loved seeing the game that got me into Oddwolrd remade, but also it was a return to making games for Oddworld, and I can't be happier to see them back ‚ô°

North America btw

I still remember vividly playing Munch's Odyssey for the first time in one of those Gamestop Demo stations. I loved it so much I asked for that game along with an Xbox on Christmas '01.

Stranger's wrath is the GOAT! Played it on mobile all day back in the day, GG.

My favorite odd world game is strangers wrath. I played it as a kid on Xbox. It really sparked my imagination at the time due to using creatures as ammunition for the crossbow. I would often imagine doing the same when playing in the yard. North America. Atlanta Georgia.

Strangers wrath has always been my favourite Oddworld game. Such a good story that I'd love to play again on switch!

I've only ever played Oddworld New 'N Tasty, which I rather enjoyed, but have been intrigued by the series for a long while, especially Strangers Wrath which looks quite the cocktail of game genres.
