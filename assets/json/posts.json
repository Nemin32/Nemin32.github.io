Ok, enough of that emotional\nstuff, let's get down to business. Abe's hair is in a ponytail for a\nvery simple reason. Have you ever seen that show, \"When Factory Work\nGoes Bad?\" Trust me, you don't want your hair getting caught in one of\nthose machines! Always, ALWAYS wear a ponytail!

His stitches may have loosened over\nthe years, but that forced vow of silence taught Abe to keep his\nemotions to himself, or at least keep them quiet. Abe is blue because\nhe’s sad.

If not, than theoreticaly, if two mudokens possesed each other,\nwould that effectivley swap their bodies?\n\n","answer":"Abe is the only Mudokon I know with the ability to possess\nothers, but it’s not a power unique to him. It’s one of those\nlong-forgotten practices that wise old Mudokon shamans spent their\nentire lives learning to perform for mere seconds at a time. There\nalways has to be someone who comes along and shows everyone else up, and\nin the field of possession, that’s Abe. I don’t think Mudokons can\npossess each other.

Mudokons have feather-like hair that can be put in a hundred\nand one styles, and the ponytail just happens to be one of the most\npractical. Myself I prefer the elegance of a topknot.

Hows the tea? I have two questions.\nFirst is how did the inhabitants of Oddworld develop a Germanic language\nsuch as English as their lingua franca throughout the entire planet\nalong with the Latin alphabet? How did everyone start using them? Im\nsure everyone had their own unique language (besides the whistling and\nmechanical grunts). I mean the unique names of everything in Oddworld\ndoes point out there must be something. Also with the usage of “Gulags”\nim guessing someone (or something) must have spoken Russian at some\npoint in time?\n\n","answer":"I’ll go ahead guess you’ve been exposed to Oddworld in an\nEnglish-speaking country. Those fans who live in France, German, Italy\nor Spain probably disagree with what we speak. It’s translation for the\nsake of you guys that don’t understand the languages of Oddworld. The\nvarious races, cultures and classes on Oddworld all developed with their\nown languages and dialects. Native people used ancient tongues that\ntended towards melody and harmony, reflecting their overall cultural\nattitudes. The industrialists shrugged off their heritage in favor of\nlanguage that enabled their lifestyles, becoming at the same time more\nclinically accurate and shamelessly deceitful.\n"},{"question":"Second is a simple one. What does Abe live in? Maybe a\nhouse/hut/rondavel/shack/kraal/homestead or nothing at all? (yes me is\nSouth African)\n\n","answer":"Abe’s got his own hut, but I don’t go there unless it’s urgent.\nIt’s always filled with toadying, over-awed fanmuds who clutter up the\nplace with their useless reverency. I’m happy for Abe, I really am, but\nthose guys need to get off their praise train and get to work building\nmy bonfire!\n"},{"question":"Are the clackers, outlaws, and stranger living in the same\ntime you are or from the past?\n\n","answer":"Their story is happening at the same time as ours, just in a\ndifferent part of the land.\n"},{"question":"hey alf i was wondering, i’ve heard of a very old story about\nsomething called nod’s oddysee, some places on the net say it was a real\noddworld project that was cancelled others say it was started by some\nforum. was this ever an idea for an oddworld game?\n\n","answer":"It’s always satisfying to put an annoying rumor to bed. I have\nnever in my life heard of anyone called Nod, and I can assure you that\nno one has a name as silly as that.

How much would they be worth? I dunno.\nThey’ve done much, much worse to the Glukkon economy than any of the\nOutlaws have done to the Clakkerz. But Abe and Munch aren’t in Western\nMudos, and even if they were, the Glukkons are more likely to hire\nprofessional security services than outsource their work to local\nentrepreneurs.\n"},{"question":"Alf, are you wanted by somebody? Are there Mudoken\nPolice?\n\n","answer":"I think you must be confusing me with somebody else. I’ve never\nbroken any law, except that time I threw an empty bottle of Brew at a\nSlig guard. Luckily there was a boiler for me to dive behind and he\nnever worked out it was me, although he did give me funny looks after\nthat. Probably because every time I saw him I burst out laughing.

Given the, shall we say, borderline homicidal behavior\nFleeches are known for, how was such a thing possible? Strict obedience\ntraining?\n\n","answer":"It’s not a problem when they’re small. When they’re small, the\nworst damage they can do is remove dirt and grime from all those\nhard-to-reach places, which is exactly why they’re sold as pets in the\nfirst place.

If you boss is ruthless enough, you’d be scared\nof them whether they were dead, comatose, missing or on vacation. And\nMolluck is one ruthless boss.

Thanks for your time Alf\nbuddie. \n\n","answer":"Well, actually, by possessing a Glukkon, you ARE\n“self-disrupting' him. If you want to kill him, or make him\nself-destruct, that is another story. Personally, I think it is more\nentertaining to play with their minds.\n"},{"question":"Dear Alf Why are Glukkons profit crazy and evil? Were they born\nbad?

What happened between Abe's\nExoddus and Munch's Oddysee? How much time was there in between them? A\nfew days? Weeks? How did Abe come across the Almighty Raisin? Do Big\nFace and the Almighty Raisin know each other? Did they meet before\nMunch's Oddysee? Will Big Face return in the next Oddworld game? Okay,\nso its more than a few questions but only one more question. In the\nopening movie for Abe's Exoddus where you and Abe first get into Necrum\nMines, did the Mudokon push Abe off or did he fall? If the mudokon did\npush him, were you that mud? Thanks Alf!\n\n","answer":"Between AE and MO? Well, let's see, there was the big one,\nthen my downward spiral into black tea drinking, the goat tee phase, my\ncubist period, my blue period, my lack of punctuation period (spawned by\nthe internet), and then the inevitable feta and avocado on flatbread\nperiod. Odd how I love flatbread. It is like bread, only satisfyingly\nflat! Ok, so that was probably more information than you wanted, but\njust one more useless tidbit: I may or may not have pushed Abe. Those\nmemories are foggy, very foggy!!!..\n"},{"question":"Dear Alf, I think all of the Oddworld games have been great so\nfar.

Ain’t no shortage of different faiths on\nOddworld! You got your theistic ones, but talk to us Mudokons or the\nGrubbs and you’ll find we’re more interested in the spirit world that\nintersects our own. Everything’s got its own spirit if ya know how to\nsee it (a loada Spooce never won’t help): the creatures, the plants, the\nrivers and mountains.

He’s obsessed with the stuff. Odd knows what any of it prattles\non about, but he sure is quick to give Abe a helping handscar or two. Oh\nsure, we’re all very grateful!

There ain’t some pervasive\nforce o’ malevolence telling ’em what to do. They just don’t care about\nwho they step on to achieve their goals, because everyone’s done such a\ngreat job of making them think that.

Obviously we’re ‘people’ with family and culture and hopes and\ndreams and faith and technology. We’re not just crawling about like\ncritters wanting for nothing more than food and safety… well, not most\ndays, anyway. But ask anyone raised in the Civilized parts of Mudos and\nthey’ll think we’re exactly that kind of knuckle-dragging barbarian.\nIt’s a lot easier to buy that latest Opple Fone when you’re told the\nslaves that stitched it together aren’t people, after all.\nScientifically we’re animals because we evolved from other animals, but\nask a Mudokon Shaman and they’ll tell you we’ve actually lost something\nin the process: that deep, natural connection to the spirit world.

Tell\ntwo, and I will give you a cyberhug.\n\n","answer":"Sligs are pretty useless. They survived by keeping out of\neveryone’s way. They spent their days feeling sorry for themselves. Not\na surprise they jumped at the chance to take out their frustrations on\nlowly Mudokon slaves as soon as it was offered to them. A couple of\njokes, hmmm. What do you call a Slig without pants?

Plus, what came with the\naward?\n\n","answer":"Just by being a Floor Waxer? JUST?!! That’s a tough job for a\nMudokon to get! Abe paid his dues and learned all the tricks as a Junior\nFloor Waxer. Plus, Abe was THE Floor Waxer. Those floors were so shiny\nthat they’d blind anything looking directly at it. Good thing that’s\nwhat he was supposed to do… I’m sure if the wrong person went blind, Abe\nwould have been Most Wanted long before his Oddysee. What came with the\naward? Only what was prized most: less slig-beatings.\n"},{"question":"Is the reason Abe was employee of the-month at Farms\nreally just because he is two-elevenths Glukkon on his half-uncle’s\nside.\n\n","answer":"Yeah right!

In the recent\nbunch of screenshots for MO, Abe seems to be sort of staring into space.\nThe Sligs and Munch look awesome, but Abe looks. . . well, sort of\nstupid. Please explain.\n\n","answer":"You are, of course, entitled to your opinion. Your obvious\nlack of training in the studies of anatomy and simple common sense\nserves to explain your comments. Abe's eye sockets are of the rotator\ncup variety, which allow him to swivel his eyes in virtually any\ndirection, much like a chameleon.

I once knew a guy\nwho had some sort of operation done and thereafter called himself\n\"Linda\", but I suppose that doesn't count. Not really! I'm just feeling\nfeisty.

You just gotta be patient.\n"},{"question":"In the first two games of Oddworld, can Sligs tell if other Sligs\nare possessed? Any time I possess one and say hi to another, they reply,\nand then blow me away.\n\n","answer":"When Abe was first starting out, he didn't have good control\nover his powers. When he'd possess a Slig, the Slig would be all glassy\neyed, and stumble around like a zombie. It wasn't very convincing. He's\ngotten much better lately, as you'll see.\n"},{"question":"Why is it that Abe has to die in the bad ending? All the time you\nplay, you grow more respect for the little guy. Then, at the end, he\ngets sliced into bite-sized chunks. Surely Mudokons are more forgiving\nthan that!\n\n","answer":"It's not so much forgiveness, as rescuing Abe from the\nclutches of Molluck the Glukkon wasn't an easy thing. Especially when\nyou don't have many lives, rescued mudokons to work with. Chanting like\nthat to create a rescue portal takes years off your life.\n"},{"question":"What do you have to do to get a good ending anyway?\n\n","answer":"Rescue enough guys so that they'll rescue you back.

I've\nkept them as Universal as I can think them to be, so I hope you don't\nspot any that are really \"knucklehead.\" Why is that Slig wearing a dress\non the right of the Land Muggers picture?\n\n","answer":"That is a game show host (ess). Since all sligs are male\n(except the queen, and she's as big as a house literally) that has to be\na guy slig in a dress. He's following in the fine tradition of Milton\nBerle and Monty Python and Ru Paul.\n"},{"question":"Do Gabbits build things underwater?\n\n","answer":"Not that I know of.

Almost like real rock stars!\n"}],"dear-alf-may-2011":[{"question":"Q: Two questions for you Alf: 1) Abe’s voice changed a little compared to Oddysee. Why is that?\n\n","answer":"Freed slaves love to learn about the forgotten practices of\ntheir people. Art, stories, building, hunting, tea brewing: our lives\ntransform from drudgery to discovery. When your soul is uplifted in that\nway, your voice tends to follow suit.\n"},{"question":"2) How come Scrabs in Abe’s Oddysee/Exoddus are very territorial and\nagressive towards other Scrabs and in Munch’s Oddysee they walk in\ngroups? Maybe they realized that they’re few in Oddworld (since\nRuptureFarms reduced most to cakes) and they thought that’s safer to\nhang in herds?\n\n","answer":"In the wild, Alpha Scrabs keep control over herds of lesser\nScrabs. If you thought a single Scrab was lethal, wait till you\nencounter the whole dance troupe! The poor creatures in the temples have\nbeen locked in small spaces for years and gone a bit cranky.

A\nmore important question is why are you walking off the cliff? Clouds or\nno, that kind of behaviour leads to injury. Sit down, my friend. Here’s\nsome tea. Tell Alfie all about it.\n"},{"question":"Also, do you own and ride your own elum?\n\n","answer":"I like to ride my Elum far into the forests where I know no one\nwill ask me annoying questions. No, I won’t let you borrow it, you’re\nnot covered by the insurance.\n"},{"question":"Sup Alf, I wanted to know how Munch must feel. After\nthe sonar that punctured his skull and how the baby Gabbits are doing. I\nalso wanted to know why abe never seems to put on any weight in all of\nhis appearances. Tell Munch and Abe I said Hello!\n\n","answer":"I haven’t actually seen any baby Gabbits around, so either they\nhaven’t come out of the water yet or they haven’t even come out of the\ncan. I hope Munch doesn’t leave them in the can too long, something that\nshiny and rare is going to attract the attention of a passing industrial\ncreep.\n\nAbe not put on weight? You’re obviously not the dedicated friend who’s\nhad to carry him home after a night out.\n"},{"question":"Are Sligs naturally two-limbed creatures with vestigal\ntails? Or are modern-day Sligs the degenerate descendants of\n‘proto-Sligs’ who lost their legs (and perhaps their eyes and faces) due\nto the use of mechanical replacement appendages?\n\n","answer":"Sligs have two limbs, it’s just how Odd made them. They also\nhave eyes and faces, it’s just that the less you see them, the better\nyou sleep at night.\n"},{"question":"Hey Alf, I promise to only post this question once this time, in\nAbe’s Exoddus I noticed all the mudokon skulls were toothless but then\nduring the cutscene in Munch’s Oddysee where Abe is pushed into the big\nwell they have teeth, so do mudokons have teeth or not?\n\n","answer":"I should think if you’ve seen us with teeth in our mouth, then\nwe have teeth in our mouth. Anatomy 101.\n"},{"question":"Hello once again Alf. I have more questions: 1. I was wondering, if the bad ending of Abe’s Exoddus was canon,how different would your life be?\n\n","answer":"Well I wouldn’t have opened a popular chain of rehabs for\nstarters. I probably wouldn’t have the job of answering all these\nquestions. Hey, is it too late to make it canon?\n"},{"question":"2. The Zapplies that Stranger has are always with him. They must be\npretty loyal. Can you tell me how he got them and that vacuum-thing he\nbounties creatures with?\n\n","answer":"Zappflies aren’t rare in the scorched desert. He probably just\nhas a lump of rotten meat in his ammo bag to attract them. His bounty\ncan, now that’s a weird contraption. Imagine being able to keep large\ncreatures in tiny containers. It’s just nonsense!\n"},{"question":"Hi Alf, I was wondering, if there was any religion on OddWorld\nand if so which one is the main ones and do the natives and\nindustrialists follow separate ones, thamks\n\n","answer":"There are almost as many religions and beliefs on Oddworld as\nthere are Inhabitants! Native Mudokons cling to their old traditions\nwhich are typically a mix of animism, ancestor worship, shamanism and so\non, although the specifics differ between tribes. Industrial races have\nmostly abandoned spirituality so they can pursue profit without any\npesky morals getting in the way, but weaker minded species subscribe to\nfearful superstitions.\n"},{"question":"Dear Alf, I have a couple of questions for you.\nFirstly, does the Mudokon species actually change colour depending on\ntheir mood, or is that “chameleon-like-feature” only visible to the\nplayer to make game play easier?\n\n","answer":"Our skin certainly changes color with our mood. Doesn’t yours?\nIt’s probably not as dramatic as you make it sound, though.\n"},{"question":"Also, what can you tell us about the Vykkers and the Vykkers\nConglomerate that we don’t already know?\n\n","answer":"That depends entirely on what you don’t already know. Tell you\nwhat, let me know what you don’t already know, and then I’ll tell it\nback to you. How’s that sound?\n"},{"question":"I read somewhere that Muds are descended from birds, which\nmakes the portals, feathery ponytails and general fragility of Mudokons\nhighly understandable. But what about Clackers? Are they just short, fat\nMuds, or do they stem from another genealogy completely?\n\n","answer":"Mudokons related to Clakkerz??? I’ve never heard anything so\nabsurd in all my life.\n"},{"question":"Is there any relation between paramite and scrabs? If I\nrember right early artwork call them “arachnid jr.” and “arachnid sr.”\nrespectively.\n\n","answer":"You people won’t be happy until every Oddworld creature is\ncousins with every other Oddworld creature!\n"},{"question":"1. In AE, Abe uses SoulStorm brew for his farting powers. How\ncome he didn’t get addicted to the stuff like the other Mudokons did? He\ndrank quite a lot of it.\n\n","answer":"What you didn’t get to see is all the time Abe spent in my\nrehab getting over the dependence he’d developed. It wouldn’t exactly\nhave made good gameplay.\n"},{"question":"2. What food do the Natives eat? Surely not the products sold by the\nGlukkons!\n\n","answer":"No, that stuff is bad! Filled with toxins and plastics and\nnasties. We get our food from growing and harvesting plants, and from\nrearing and hunting critters. Of course we do it all sustainably, with\ntotal respect for nature and the land and the food itself.\n"},{"question":"3. What ever happened to Big Face?! I read somewhere that he went into\nhiding because he thought he accidently killed Abe when he knocked him\nof the podium??\n\n","answer":"He’s not hiding in my basement! Uh oh… Please don’t call the\nMudokops!\n"},{"question":"4. What does Abe do all day, now that he seems to have some spare\ntime?\n\n","answer":"Watch videos of himself on YouTube.\n"},{"question":"5. And finally, I know you guys can view fan art (considering you have\na section on this website dedicated to it; which I will contribute to\nwhen the holidays come around) and on the old website you had OddVerse,\nbut can you guys also read Fanfiction? I know novel writters can’t, but\ncan you guys? (I really hope so!)\n\n","answer":"Generally not, for much the same reasons. We’ve got our own\nstories to tell, and if they just happen to resemble ones sent to us,\nthat could be seen as suspicious unless we’ve made it perfectly clear we\ndon’t read fan fiction. Don’t get us wrong, it thrills us to see folks\nhaving the inspiration to get creative, so keep at it!\n"},{"question":"What do Mudokon babies look like?\n\n","answer":"They look like full grown Mudokons but smaller. Oversized heads\nand eyes, they’re tremendously cute. In photos, anyway. Put the camera\naway and it’s all tantrums and diaper changes.\n"},{"question":"I got 2 questions. First, if we ever do get to see the end of the\nQuintology, will there be 5 moons?\n\n","answer":"This question intrigued me, so I went to ask my astrology buddy\nif moons could suddenly appear over time. He gave me a weird look and\ntold me in no uncertain terms that just because Munch’s Moon\nspontaneously manifested in the sky, doesn’t mean three more will. I\nasked what would happen if they did, and he just huffed and puffed about\nhaving to redraw all his charts again. That guy bugs me. I hope there’ll\nbe more moons.\n"},{"question":"Also, I am currently working on a Mudokon costume (big fan). In order\nto do so I banded some of my fingers together, and they are now changing\ncolors. Should I see a doctor, or use the coloring as the rest of the\ncostumes skin tone?\n\n","answer":"You don’t say what color your fingers have turned, so I’m going\nto presume it’s a healthy green hue. If that’s the case, then your skin\nis probably just reverting to its natural state. Years of living indoors\ndulls one’s vibrancy. A return to nature restores skin tones and overall\nhealth, physical and emotional. Alternatively, you’ve picked up a dermal\nfungus. Go to your doctor and get that stuff scrubbed off.\n"},{"question":"I have always wondered where outlaws got there names from? I\nmean Where Do the names Blisters Booty and Boils Booty come from?

They’re usually far deadlier than what the current\npredicament might be before entering.\n\n","answer":"Oh my odd, that’s… that right there is what they call nightmare\nflub!

And I don’t mean like an Amazonian.\nThe eggs come from them.\n"},{"question":"Dear Alf if you had to choose between Abe and Big Face to lead\nthe mudokons who would you choose?\n\n","answer":"As far as I’m aware, we don’t have a single leader and never\nhave. Big Face is a spiritual leader, although by no means the only one.\nAbe is more of a political-slash-military leader. How can I possibly\npick one? I suppose Abe has freed more of us and incited us to fight for\nour freedom more than Big Face has. Or maybe Big Face accomplished a\nbutt-load before Abe and I were even born. I just don’t know. I have a\nfeeling I’d regret it, but I guss I’d have to go with Abe.\n"},{"question":"Who is big face and why is he blue like abe???\n\n","answer":"Maybe it’s Abe from the future, come back to set the whole\nQuintology in motion! Dun dun duuuun!\n"},{"question":"Hey Alf, would Glukkons bring up the notion of hiring another\nspecies as sadistic peacekeepers just to scare sligs into working\nharder?\n\n","answer":"Sligs don’t need to work harder. They’re cheap, expendable, and\nthey get the job done. True they topple like dumbinoes when Abe’s\nbarging into the place, but there’s no way of predicting when that will\nhappen. Better just to hire a few extra personnel to ensure your\npersonal safety and make do with the insurance when your franchise goes\nkablooey. But until that fateful day, Sligs’ incompetance is no match\nfor their effectiveness.\n"},{"question":"hey alf! hey why do sligs need all the machinery on them, on\nthe face, such as the eyes or even the tubes. do they need it because\nthey have a hard time breathing or seeing or somthing?\n\n","answer":"Breathing, seeing, speaking, looking attractive enough to not\ncause everyone around you to spontaneously erupt in irrepressible\nvolcanoes of vomit – Sligs have trouble with all of it. They’re just\nawfully built creatures, not suited to any kind of skilled or\nintelligent work. All their good for is taking their own frustration and\njealousy and turning it into hatred of everyone around them.\n"},{"question":"Hey, just a few questions about this chapter in Abe’s life;\n\n","answer":"Well, I suppose that is what I’m here for. Fine, shoot.\n"},{"question":"1.) What is the reproductive system of Interns; are they\nhermaphrodite’s like Vykkers, have two genders or do they have a\nqueen?\n\n","answer":"Uh, I guess whichever of those means they all look the same and\nlike the same things. The first one. Or the last one. Or any other one.\n"},{"question":"2.) Why were Intern Shock Rockers cut from the game?\n\n","answer":"Shock Rockers are a fine idea until you realize that your\nInterns are working in metal environments, with co-workers wearing metal\nand critter cages that open when a large voltage is delivered to them.\nEven if those electrified batons saved a few Interns’ lives from escaped\nFuzzles getting toothy on their captors, dozens more would be lost to\nFuzzle stampedes and accidental electrocutions. The danger is worse in\nthe sewers of Vykkers Labs, especially during Prune Consumption Week.\nThat’s why Shock Rockers aren’t around.\n"},{"question":"3.) What are Glukkon/Vykker and Slig/Intern relations or Vykker/Slig\nand Glukkon/Intern for that matter?\n\n","answer":"Of those combinations, the only ones that really interact are\nGlukkons and Vykkers, and even then only because they have to. Glukkons\nand Vykkers are separate industrial families with their own interests.\nSometimes that means cooperating, sometimes that means competing.\nOftentimes it means using Shrinks as less disturbing business\nnegotiators. Sligs and Interns also come from separate security firms\nand probably wouldn’t get along for no more reason than that.\n"},{"question":"4.) Will the gabbits die out after the 150 eggs or do they have two\ngenders?\n\n","answer":"I doubt the Raisin would have sent Abe and Munch to get the can\nif he wasn’t certain it was essential for the survival of the Gabbit\nspecies. I can’t wait to find out what happens when that can opens.\nHopefully it’s eggs and not worms inside.\n"},{"question":"5.) Where is Lulu now?\n\n","answer":"Wherever the desperate, the needy, the poor and the excluded go\nwhen society won’t give them a leg (or arm) to stand on: the street.\n"},{"question":"I have just been wondering; what is the backstory of Doc? Was he a\nVykker from Vykkers Lab 13? And if so; did he survive the explosion or\nleave due to differences? Or from somewhere all together different?\n\n","answer":"Vykkers Labs is just one business in the Vykkers’ research\narmada. Doc never worked there, but he is fully qualified and registered\nwith whatever quacks you need to qualify and register with to convince\nsmall Clakker townships that you’re a competant medical professional.\nWhy did he wind up in the middle of nowhere? Somebody’s got to. Maybe he\nlikes all the roadkill and taxidermy. Maybe he just filled a job\nposition everyone else was too proud to accept.\n"},{"question":"hey alf, How come when a mudokon, slig, glukkon, slog and\nparamite get crushed by a meat saw or blown up they shatter into pieces,\nbut scrabs don’t?\n\n","answer":"Um.

I don’t know! How can I possibly know? I’ve never been there,\nand even if I had why would I risk destroying the fabric of spacetime by\ninterfering with it? No, no more. If anyone asks me anything else about\nthe future I’m just going to fart in their face.\n"},{"question":"Hi Alf! I was wondering: Who shall survive in a hypothetical\nclash between a scrab and a meech?\n\n","answer":"Scrab. Meeches are tough, but they could only compete with a\nScrab if they’re in a pack. Note that Meeches are always in a pack. Not\nany more, obviously. Extinction puts a real crimp in your social life.\nJust ask Munch.\n"},{"question":"I was just wondering, Was it true whats on wikipedia\nabout there nearly being a lawsuit in japan about abe and his friends\nhaving 4 fingers? and that the game was altered to have only 3 fingered\nabe? Thanks alot!\n\n","answer":"It wasn’t a lawsuit, it was extortion. They didn’t want\nfour-fingered characters to be shown in the country for historical\ncultural reasons. That might be perfectly alright except they were\nwilling to compromise their own rule if they were paid enough. They were\nusing a very dark part of their country’s past to profit, and we weren’t\ncool with that. So instead of giving them the cash, we gave them the\nfinger.\n"},{"question":"Hey Alf, What IS the password for Packrat Palooka’s hideout?\n\n","answer":"I’m looking in the original script and apparently it’s “String\nof short and long beeps to indicate censored vulgarity”. That sound\nright?\n"},{"question":"Alf, I know that the subject of cloning is two months ago, but\nI want to address this subject if it’s not too much trouble. I also knew\nthat cloning will have some benefits, such as replacing inefficient\norgans and organ systems and bringing extinct creatures back to life;\nhowever, if the Vykkers invented cloning, then there is a chance that\nthe Glukks and the Vykkers might clone Mudokons without their knowledge\nor conscent. With all this information in mind, what is your view of\nMudokon cloning?\n\n","answer":"Cloning Mudokons is a horrific and detestable idea. The only\nfamilies with the technology to do that are the ones who will use the\nclones for nothing good. Imagine the scale of torture and mistreatment,\nthe terror and suffering that will ensue. Imagine the power of their war\nmachine if it’s powered by millions of cheap-to-replace Mudokons.\nImagine how disposable we’ll all become.\n\nBut I wouldn’t mind being cloned.

Has the idea of making\na 3d oddworld game on a 2d track (a' la Contra: Shattered Soldier or\nDuke Nukem Manhattan Project) been kicked around at all? I felt that the\nmain reason that I liked the first 2 Oddworld games were that they were\nbeautifully done 2d games in an era where the industry was moving into\n3d, they kind of showed that 2d still has it's place in the industry.\nAnd now with Oddworld and Castlevania as well going 3d I'm wondering if\n2d is actually heading out to pasture for good. Thanks in advance for\ntaking the time to read this. Oh, and regardless of my preferences for\ngameplay I just wanted to congratulate the folks over at Oddworld\nInhabitants for creating a world with so muchh beauty and depth. Thanks\nagain, Kenny\n\n","answer":"Well first of all, thank ya from all the Inhabitants! That is\na huge compliment. As much as we all love the first two 2D games, (you\naren't the first to point it out), the background of the founders of\nOddworld is steeped in 3D tradition. Sherry and Lorne both come from the\n3D effects industry, and are always looking for new challenges and ways\nof expressing the Oddworld story. So the goal is to eventually move into\n4D and 5D, where in real time is actually REAL TIME, and you can\nactually taste and smell everything, creating the first-ever, fully\nfunctional immersive video game experience.

As far as\nDripik losing his eye, I don't think he lost an eye; he's just too\nstupid to realize he put the patch thing on.\n"},{"question":"I have a question. I've enjoyed all three games so far, but in\nMunch's Oddysee, I noticed something strange about Abe. His eyes seem to\nglow in the dark, and I'm sure I didn't see this in the previous games.\nSince you're his friend, could you tell me if they have always been like\nthat? Or did something happen to him?\n\n","answer":"He got a lot of tattoos, and a lot of powers... I think he may\nbe having more of the usual healthy little glow we all have. I mean, he\nis the big Kahuna here on Oddworld. I guess it helps him see in the\ndark.\n"},{"question":"Hiya Alf!\n\nI've been a fan of Oddworld for a while, and have been writing a few\nquestions too. From now on, I'm gonna call myself Oddguy, don't ask why\nI just am. I'll give myself a made up name so you can know which\nquestions I write.\n\nAnyway, I think those stupid glukkons should do some of the work, and\nnot just have the sligs do it for them while they sit on their big but.\nI think there should be a flying Gluk, or something. A glukkon could be\nin a flying harness like a flying slig and hold a gun or something. That\nwould be cool.\n\nAnyway I played and beat Munch's Oddysee, and I want to know what to\nexpect in the next game. I heard it's called The Hand of Odd or\nsomething. If you can't give me info on that then please tell me how the\nindustrialists took over the Mudokon and gabbit's lives. I heard that\nMudokons used to be the most powerful creatures on Oddworld. Then the\nGlukkons took over. How? I want to hear the whole story in the\nbeginning.\n\nAn answer to both of my questions would be nice hehe.\n\nBye, Oddguy\n\n","answer":"Glukkons are the ones in power—that's why they get to sit\naround. I would say the Sligs should rise up and overthrow them myself,\nbut it doesn't seem to be in the cards, since the Sligs are as dumb as a\nbag of hair.\n\nThe scumbag Glukkons came into power, because they didn't care WHO they\nstepped on or WHAT they ruined to get there. Once you throw all your own\npersonal motives out there first, you wind up being a bad man, like\nthese Glukkon clowns! I say we put them all on a sligshot to Oddworld's\nmoon...\n\nAlso, the whole first game is based on the Glukkons taking power, maybe\nyou should give it a whirl first, and see if that answers any of your\nquestions. You can read about the history of Oddworld at \n[www.xbox.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20050205122123/http://www.xbox.com/news/0203/oddworldhistory.htm)\n"},{"question":"Hey Alf I have some questions for you. I would really like you\nanswer them because it would be annoying for both of us if I had to send\nthis to you over and over again until you finally gave me an answer. Why\ndoesn't your section in the Oddworld Universe have as much information\nas Abe's or Munch's. You are just as interesting as both of them\ncombined?\n\n","answer":"Sigh. I keep tellin' 'em at Oddworld about having an all-Alf\ngame, see above. Still waiting for that call back, y'all! I did make an\nappearance in the new UYI video. Check out the images on top of this\npage.

I don't travel much,\nand I'm not quite the jumper I once was. I used to be able to run around\nthe house a couple of times and not even be tired! Of course, that's\nwhen I was usually being chased by something...\n"},{"question":"Have you ever eaten a Mudokon Pop? If so, what does your species\ntaste like?\n\n","answer":"Aw, c'mon. Did you ever have a people-steak?

I thought the creatures of Oddworld were supposed to be nothing\nlike the things on earth? . I mean they look nothing like creatures here\nbut they sound like things from earth. can u tell me why??\n\n","answer":"There are plenty of creatures that don't speak or make sense,\nbut it varies from adventure to adventure. I have yet to hear a fuzzle\nmake sense, or a fleech to give a speech! Hey, that's pretty good: To\nhear a Fleech give a speech. Kinda like the earlier one fish two fish\nthing. Maybe a got a knack for this kinda thing...\n"},{"question":"What can you tell me about the queens Sam, Maggie and Skillya?\n\n","answer":"They are indeed queens of different species in Oddworld. We've\nheard about them and seen images of them. Their stories have not been\ntold ... yet. Remember Oddworld is a big place!\n"},{"question":"Also do u have any information on the mudokon mother?? According\nto all the info on some web sites and the Abe's Exoddus game she was\nsupposed to make an appearance in Munch's Oddysee but there was no sign\nof her or the shrink?!\n\nare any females of the respective species i.e. glukkons, vykkers etc\ngoing to be shown in future games??\n\nhow come you didn't make an appearance in Munch's Oddysee, Alf??\n\nalso do u have any information on what a sea rex is??\n\nand what a chronicler is??\n\nis the planet Abe and the rest of them live on called Oddworld or is\nthere another name for it??\n\nfinally do u have any info on the next game or is another bonus game\nlikely?? There have been rumors about it being called Squeek's Oddysee,\nis this true??\n\n","answer":"Whoa, whoa WHOA! Too much at once! These questions were asked\nbefore and the answer is the same: We can't reveal all the characters in\nevery game. The world is alarge place here on Oddworld, and the point\nisn't to show you everyone in one game, but to have different adventures\nthat give a little here, a little there. If we show you all the same\ncharacters every game, well, then it's not really a new adventure, is\nit? We dole out the fun, equally each game, and some characters change\nand evolve, others are new, and others have yet to be revealed. The\nplanet is Oddworld and we live in the continent of Mudos.

You’d never catch me going near\ntheir nests at the best of times, but when there are cranky, protective\nparents on the patrol, yeah, nah, count me out.

Sure some birds will pick bits out of large creatures’\nmouths, but even they’re not foolish enough to go in a Fuzzle’s mouth.\nSo if you do have a put Fuzzle, don’t go flossing its teeth… One mild\nstartle and you’ll be missing more than just a finger!\n"},{"question":"\\#DearAlf Hey Alf Is Abe And The Rest of You Have Pet\nScrabs And Paramites also Are You Friends With Some Glukkons. \\<3 you\nAlf.\n\n","answer":"No! You do not keep Scrabs and Paramites as pets! If you’re\nreally, really, extraoddinarily brave and calm and talented and wise\nand patient and lucky, you can “tame” them. It ain’t do with domestics,\nit’s more like coming to an agreement that benefits everybody. Friends\nwith Glukkons? Are you kidding me? Would YOU sit and chat merrily with\nyour genocidal oppressors? Ya gotta be off yur rocker, mister. \\<3 you\ntoo.\n"},{"question":"Hey Alf, I have a question for you! How do you think you or\nany other Mudokon would react if a Scrab just kind of walked into the\nvillage, and just sat there and did nothing agressive? I know it would\nbe impossible, but maybe it has some brain condition or something and it\ngot just so confused it didnt know what to do anymore.\n\n","answer":"Same thing we’d do any dangerous creature came to us, weirdly\ncalm or otherwise: try and catch it safely and either release it back\ninto the wild or keep it to use. Maybe the frosty hermit that lives in\nthe forest wants to commune with it, see if it’s bringing a message. Or\nmaybe our berries stocks are getting low and we could use the extra\nfood.

You can, of\ncourse, purchase the game on the delightful Steam platform!

Will you make any new games? And will the Spooce\nArcher be back?\n\n","answer":"We’ve never considered ourselves bound by any single genre\nbefore, and we’re not going to start now.

We broke our backs designing these things for a reason:\nto be seen!\n"},{"question":"3. Munch’s Oddysee had it’s problems during production. The serious\nnature of the previous Oddworld titles seemed somewhat lost. Would you\never consider remaking the game, the way you originally intended it to\nbe?\n\n","answer":"Munch will take exception to that. Why do you want to make him\ngo through all that again?

Nah, I’m just teasing you. I know what you mean! Gotta say I\ndon’t really know much about the atmosphere apart from it helps with the\nold breathing malarkey.

Or more info about her in general. Also will we be\nseeing baby Mudokons or how they are raised?\n\n","answer":"Yes. Probably.

I was wondering, how do the different vending machines\nin Munch’s Oddysee work? How to the drinks make Abe and Much invisible?\nWas it the Vykkers?\n\n","answer":"Vendos work by being covered in flashy cartoon ads and located\neverywhere you turn, and you’ll find them stocked full of products by\nall sorts of industrial families.

But one thing Genshi no\nunderstand; Oddworld wikia say mudokon evolve from birds if mudokon type\nof bird that make them archosaur species yet unlike all archosaur\nspecies mudokon have mouth in stead of beak, flat nails like simian\nprimate, and four digits on hand like artiodactyl. But genshi no know\nwhat “birds” on Oddworld look like so mudokon may look much like\nOddworld bird.\n\n","answer":"Archosaur? Artiodactyl? I don’t know what those are. Maybe your\nbirds and people evolved in very different ways to ours. Your world\nsounds weird.\n"},{"question":"Also, Genshi curious about mudokon female. There only one known\nmudokon female. Where rest of them? without females mudokon species die\nso there must be female Mudokons somewhere.\n\n","answer":"Well I guess that makes sense, so they must be somewhere, but I\nsure haven’t seen them. But then by that logic there’d have to be male\nMudokons as well, and I haven’t seen any of those either.\n"},{"question":"Oh and PS: How long are the days on Oddworld — in hours? Thanks!\n\nHow far is the planet of Oddworld from Earth?\n\nwhere is oddworld and is there realy hd abe coming out\n\n","answer":"Oddworld exists in a different part of reality, another\ndimension, a bajillion light millennia away in all and zero directions,\nutterly unrelated to the world you know, a fractured reflection of each\nother’s world. We’ve got our own sun and orbit and rotation and time\nzones and clocks and calendars and laws of relativity.

One on its own would spell doom\nenough, a whole flock of them would plow through anything they wanted.\nAlas, no more!

Where’s Crig lately?? He owes me some moolah.\n\n","answer":"You don’t seriously expect to get that Moolah, do you? Sure, I\ncould tell you where he is. But then he could bring a bunch of cronies\nand shoot my rehab up. Nah, you’re ok. Just make do with your remaining\npeenies.\n"},{"question":"Also, what are some of your favorite activities for your spare time?\n\n","answer":"When I’m not sitting down with recovering Brewaholics, I like\nto play games with my Mudokon brethren, such as Sliggy in the Middle, or\nHide & Squeek.

Next question.\n"},{"question":"2) Did you try any foods at Rupturefarms?\n\n","answer":"‘Try’? No, I never ‘tried’ it. It was the only food there was.\nWe were forced to eat it or starve. But that was ok because at the time\nwe didn’t know what we were eating. All we knew was it tasted great and\nwe couldn’t wait until the next cold slither of it was gifted to us from\nthe nearest dispenzah.\n\n3) Did you guys never met those Grubbs before in the Western Mudos?\n\n"},{"question":"Forgive me if you’ve answered a question similar to this\nbefore, but I was wondering…Your community, your whole ‘gathering’ of\nmudo’s you got goin’ on there; Is there some kind of leader or superior,\nthat maybe guides what happens? I figured that the Almighty Raisin,\nBigface and even you and Abe would probably have their words a little\nbit more valued than others! (No offense of course to anyone else) Or is\nit a democracy? Either way man, I’d be pretty content living there – you\nguys are awesome.\n\n","answer":"Traditianally, villages tend to govern themselves, usually in\nline with their parent tribe, whose elders in turn heed the wisdom of\nancients and prophets like Shamans, Spirits and the Almighty Raisin.\nRight now tribes have all but dispanded, secretive clans hidden\nthemselves away from industrialist meddling, far-flung vestiges of purer\nexistence on the fringes of populated land. An active leader like Abe\nmight be able to bring them all together by adventuring to their\nsettlements and organizing propaganda drives.\n"},{"question":"Hi Alf, I was always wondering if english is official\nlanguage in Mudos (or entire Oddwolrd), or is it just translated to it.\nWhich one of these theories is correct?\n\n","answer":"I’ve never heard of ‘english’. Is it like a cross between a\nGlukkon and a Fish?\n"},{"question":"Why and when the Vykkers and Glukkons did become “friends”?\n\n","answer":"You’re right to put ‘friends’ inside inverted commas. They’re\nnot friends, they’re competing companies. One tends to focus on resource\nextraction and manufacture while the other mostly sticks to\npharmaceuticals and robotics, but they do share some markets, for\ninstance, food. Even then they’re competing for lands, contracts,\nmarketing… don’t ever mistake them for friends! On the other hand,\nthey’ll work together if they both feel they can get something out of\nit. In fact, Vykkers are contracted for a lot of research and\ntechnology, just as they contract work out to yet other industrial\nfamilies. The economic landscape of Oddworld is a twisted web.\n"},{"question":"All the glukkons and wolvarks and them know that abe’s gonna\ncome and ruin the day by either A:Turning Invisible. B: throwing their\nown grenades at them. C: Drinking coffee. and finaly D: Possessing them.\nSO why don’t they cobble it together and get rid of all the vendos and\nput in a chant supressor every 10 feet and put a security code onto the\nBOOM machines?\n\n","answer":"Whoa whoa whoa!! That’s not an inexpensive plan of operation!\nGet rid of the Vendos… what would the workers eat? A chant supressor\nevery 10 feet… do you have any idea how much a self-powered anti-gravity\ntesla coil costs? A security code on grenade dispenzahs? Well, that’s\nactually not a bad idea but it would still be a more expensive model.\nThere comes a point when you have to figure it’s more profitable to\nclaim the insurance and start a new factory somewhere else.\n"},{"question":"Hey Alf! Thanks for answering my previous question.\nI’m more of a Mudomo chap myself.

I have a question: Which Glukkons survive in Exoddus? Im putting\nthis question beacuse in Munch’s Odysee, in a newspaper we find Director\nPhleg and General Drippik tagged in a picture. As far as i know, Abe\nposessed each Glukkon ( V.P Aslik, Phleg and Drippik ) in order to gain\naccess to SoulStorm Brewery.\n\n","answer":"I don’t think you’re familiar with the fantastic cost-cutting\nmeasure known as ‘stock photo’. Those cheap tabloids will cut any corner\nto get their ridiculous point across earlier than the competition. The\nearly rag gets the Moolah!\n"},{"question":"Dear Alf, Will shrinks be in any upcoming oddworld game and\nwhat are they exacly\n\n","answer":"Shrinks are mechanical company psychologists, built to increase\nthe productivity of workers. Whether that encouragement comes in the\nform of a supportive compliment or emotional blackmail is no one’s\nconcern as long as it gets results.\n"},{"question":"Dear Alf, i need to ask for your guidance on a moral matter\nthat is preventing me to sleep pacefully.\n\n","answer":"I know Abe can’t use sligs weapons cause he don’t want to be\nswayed by glukkon mentality but why he show no restraint in using\ngranades?\n"},{"question":"In case the answer is something like “he simply don’t like guns”\nplease go and slap him one time for all the troubles that gave us.\n\n","answer":"Well, you know. Guns are heavy. Abe can fit several grenades in\nhis pocket. It’s easier!\n"},{"question":"Hey Alf, you know Abe can possess pratically anything\n(Bells, farts, sligs, slogs, etc), does that mean he can possess other\nmudokons? I mean, he could be doing it to you right now! Is he? If he\nis, hi Abe!\n\n","answer":"I certainly hope he can’t, because that would be proper scary!\nI mean, possessing the thing trying to kill you is one thing, possessing\nyour pal from across the road takes on horrible implications. What if\nyou learnt something you wish you’d never known, like “I don’t like\ntea”? That’s going to scar you for life. It’s better Abe keeps his\npossession to other species.\n"},{"question":"I have enjoyed the oddworld games for a long time and i hope\nthey continue. Two questions have been pondering my mind though. Back in\nthe days when abe had to rescue so many mudokons in exoddus. Why is it\nthat Abe never feels really bad when he kills a mudokon? If he killed\none by accident or if he was being mean, on purpose, all he could say\nwas “oops” and move on, he didnt stop, cry or even apologise to friends\nnearby if he killed one of their buddies.\n\n","answer":"Make no mistake, Abe feels pain and suffering and sadness,\noften in a much deeper way that the Mudokons around him. But when he\nkills a Mudokon he knows… he knows that… um…. Abe has never killed a\nMudokon. What, err, what are you talking about? Have you ever killed a\nMudokon?\n"},{"question":"What happened after that old, blind guy fell to his death in\nAbe’s Exoddus? Abe told him to follow him, only to make him walk right\ninto a big hole and then break his legs. Was he missed or at least\nremembered in the village?\n\n","answer":"His broken bones healed really quickly and Abe rescued him a\nlittle bit later. We were all very relieved.\n"},{"question":"My other question is if glukkons have no arms, then who built\nthe sligs\n\n","answer":"By “built the Sligs” I’m gonna suppose you mean their pants.\nLike most widespread appliances, they’re designed by Vykkers but\ncommercially manufactured by Glukkons.\n"},{"question":"and why is it that slogs respect them so much that they would even\nattack a glukkon if a slig commanded it,\n\n","answer":"Um, you said two questions. This is number three, but that’s\nfine. Slogs don’t respect Sligs. They obey them because they’ve been\nbrutally raised to know they’ll get beaten, starved and generally abused\nif they don’t. Glukkons don’t get involved in the process, so when a\nSlog sees a Glukkon it doesn’t recognize it as anything special to be\nprotected.\n"},{"question":"which reminds me, if sligs are stronger than glukkons, why dont they\njust kill em and take over.\n\n","answer":"Jeez, another question? You said two. This is your last\none. Sligs aren’t stronger than Glukkons, because Glukkons control the\nMoolah. A Slig without Moolah is a Slig withoun a gun, pants or smokes.\nAnd a Slig without those is a sticky mess on the bottom of some guy’s\nboots.\n"},{"question":"a slig revolution should i say?\n\n","answer":"NO. JUST SHUT UP.\n"}],"dear-alf-24":[{"question":"Q:  Hey Alf, how come abe cannot turn into a shrykull all the time\nbut needs a special portal? Is it spooce?\n\n","answer":"Spooce it is not.

A tear in the\notherwise oppressive fabric of fairness, if you will.\n"},{"question":"Since the sligs caught the gabbits befor at the end of the game\nwhat is going to stop them from catching the new baby gabbits again?\n\n","answer":"Hmmmm.

I just wanted to brush up my knowledge on them,\nwith your help of course! ; ).\n\nOk, I just wanted to know why do Interns realy have thier mouth sewn\nshut and feet, hoves, etc cut off? I also just wanted to know if Interns\nwere made for the Vykkers for personal use or have they always been what\nthey are today?\n\n","answer":"Yes, interns really do have their mouths sewn shut. This is to\nprevent them from whistling annoying techno and trance tunes while\nworking. Unfortunately, they can still email and surf the net.\n\nThey do also have hooves, this is hard to notice because they seem to be\nthe same size as their leg bones, unlike a horse or a pig, where the\nhoof is semi-cone-shaped. Nothing's been cut off yet, but I'm not sayin'\nit couldn't happen!\n\nThe interns weren't created, but like so many of the poor critters that\ncross the threshold of Vykker's Labs, they've undergone slight\n\"mODDifications\".\n"},{"question":"ALFY MY CHUM! I must ask a question of you, what ever became of\nfleeches and greeters and slurgs, you guys did'nt put em in the third\ngame.\n\n","answer":"They are still fleeching, greeting, and slurging around\nOddworld, they just didn't make it into Munch's story. Better luck next\ntime, ay?\n"},{"question":"Is Abe the only Mud with the power to open bird portals?\n\n","answer":"Yes, Abe is special. But I have been known to open tea\ncanisters and sugar packets. Doesn't that count for anything?\n"},{"question":"Why did the Glukkons choose Abe as an ad campaign, all Mud\nproduct posters show blue skin, not the common green. Even Mudokon Pops\nare blue!\n\n","answer":"Studies show that nine out of ten muds prefer the color blue,\nespecially in the edibles category. It's all about targeting your\nmarket, bud.\n"},{"question":"Why was Abe's mouth stapled shut? No other Muds in stapled have\nthis done to them.\n\n","answer":"Not stapled, stitched! Abe was a noisy, whiny, cry baby and\nno one could stand his incessant blabber, so they sewed him up tight.\nNot too tight to have a brew, though!\n"},{"question":"In the bad Exoddus ending you cannot see Abe's feet when he is in\nthe tear extractor, but when you see Muds in the game you can easily see\ntheir feet. Also, why do their loin-clothes stay on their legs?\n\n","answer":"What the heck are you talking about? That isn't even a\nquestion. I'm sorry that you can't see Abe's feet. There. Are you happy\nnow? And the loincloths happen to be heavily starched, OK? Every good,\nupstanding citizen of Mudos knows that a well starched Mudokon is a\nhappy Mudokon.\n"},{"question":"Hey Alf how is it going in the world of odd? And how is your tea\ncoming? My name is Dave and I am a huge Oddworld fanatic. I pretty much\nlove Oddworld so much I am a member of the Oddworld forums. Ok enough\nwith the pointless talking. I have these two iching questions and I need\nyour answer. How big is a Sea Rex? And will we see them in future\ngames?\n\n","answer":"Well things would be better if people made sense, but I don't\nwant to ask too much of the human race.\n\nANYWAY, here's some soothing ointment for your itch: It is very\ndifficult to determine the size of a sea rex because they are constantly\nundulating through the water, and are never lain out straight next to\nanother critter where you could make some kind of a comparison. I just\nknow they're big, cause no one wants to catch 'em ... either that or\nthey just taste bad! They're probably the largest animal I know of on\nOddworld, though!\n"},{"question":"Alfy baby, Ya cool by me you're actually one a my favorite\ncharacters and do the sligs despise the Glukkons even though they\nserve'em an' all?\n\n","answer":"They don't despise the glukkons, they probably aren't capable\nof thinking enough to despise them. They do, however, have a natural\ndesire for the nurturing and attention that they were deprived of as\nchildren. They are also easily impressed by status, and therefore I\nwould guess are highly susceptible to abusive relationships, such as\nserving the Gluks.\n"},{"question":"I have one question that has been bothering me for a while. What\nhappened in the desert while travelling with Abe that the cameras didn't\nshow? Anything funny?\n\n","answer":"You mean when the thing was all whatever, and we all went\nAAAAHHHH and then that one time when the hahahhahhaaaaaaaaaa! Man that\nwas so funny!

Or has his lungs\nbeen stolen.\n\n","answer":"Colony starting is a far more complicated process than one\nmight expect. You can't just dump the eggs in the water, stir well,\nrinse and repeat. These things typically take some time, so my guess is\nthat he's still in the planning stages.\n"},{"question":"When do ya hope to kick off you merchandise?

Like books, wholesome vegetables, and a warm winter coat?\n"},{"question":"Hey Alf, me again. I was wondering: where does Abe go when he's\nnot out possesing Sligs or blowing up boilers and stuff like that. I\nmean, he must have a break in between his missions, right? So what does\nhe do? Does he hang with the Big Raisin in Raisin's Cave, does he chill\nout with Big Face in Mosaic Lines, does he go drink some tea at your\nRehab and Tea?

Last I heard lately he's into hot yoga and soap making.\nSaving your species brings many changes to a mud.\n"},{"question":"And did Elum die ???\n\n","answer":"Elum is a species, so the whole species did not die, no. But\nalas, we did come to know and love Abe's Elum as far more than just a\nmode of transport. He had an untimely ending on the RuptureFarms\nchopping block. Unfortunately, Elums are known not only as good pack\nanimals, but also as a valuable commodity for Sloggy Chow and Elumer's\nGlue.\n"},{"question":"Are fuzzles predators ??? (Cuz their teeth are so sharp)\n\n","answer":"Fuzzles are little sweety-pies that have been genetically\naltered and are pretty peeved about it. Calling them a predator implies\nthat they victimize and destroy for their own personal gain, yet we saw\nin Munch's Oddysee that they are perfectly willing to do that for the\ngood of others, as well! I'd say they're more passive aggressive than\npredator.\n"},{"question":"I'm only wondering where's BigFace? I haven't seen him since Abe\nleft to Necrum Mines with his friends. Can we see him anymore?\n\n","answer":"Well, at the last sewing circle, I heard BigFace went to one\nof those \"stress reduction\" spas, and no one has seen him in weeks! If\nyou ask me it's a flimsy coverup for a face job- you have no idea how\nhard it is to live a name like \"BigFace\" down when that is exactly what\nyou have. I actually feel sorry for the chump. But you didn't hear it\nfrom me!\n"},{"question":"What powers the slig's pants? oil? gasoline? batteries?

You wouldn’t believe how bad he was at it. I\nheard one time his boss came in to find him with his feet up reading a\njuicy gossip magazine, except this one time was every single day! No\nwonder nobody got suspicious when Abe and Munch were making him super\nrich for no reason.\n"},{"question":"what is the life spawn of a mudokon and a glukkon?\n\n","answer":"Mudokons aren’t spawned live, we hatch from eggs. Pretty big\neggs, too! One of those things could feed a family of twelve for a\ncouple of days! Not that you’d ever do that, of course. Glukkons might\nbe born live, but they’re morally dead, so it doesn’t matter.\n"},{"question":"How old can Glukkons get? Or does they live forever?\nBecause i mean, you can see how old a human is but not at a Glukkon :)\n\n","answer":"Glukkons are pretty hardy and get can just. Keep. On. Going.\nFor the better part of a century if they aren’t blown to chunks by\nglowing ghostly sparkles, a renegade Slig’s bulletspray or the\noccasional factory obliteration. They certainly don’t live forever. In\nfact, by the standards of a lot of other Oddworld species, those 80-odd\nyears make for a pretty flash-in-the-pan existence. I guess you have\ntrouble telling how old a Glukkon is because you’re just not used to\nthem. If you lived your whole life in Glukkon society you’d not think\ntwice about it, which is coincidentally similar to how you’d feel about\nsteamrolling villages.\n"},{"question":"What did Meeches look like? can you draw a picture of one?\n\n","answer":"From personal experience I can tell you that they were\nhorrible, horrible, ugly and horrific things to behold. They were\nrubbery and fleshy and they oozed a horrible red pus. They used to fly\nthrough the air on metal hooks, sometimes dropping down on us poor,\nunsuspecting workers. It was all very disturbing. Then they’d cocoon\nthemselves in wooden barrels, and when they emerged again they’d\ntransformed into delicious Meech Munchies. It was all worth it in the\nend.

You think we got wardrobes of clean clothes in\nRuptureFarms? Pah, you kids today with your limitless sunglasses and\nmore than one sock, you’re barely aware you’re hatched! Why, I’d have\ngiven my left arm for a dirty rag to wipe the excess Elum-hoof grease\nout of the chutes of clogged vendos, but when all you have is a\nloincloth you’d better be prepared to use that instead. Doesn’t matter\nif you’ve been toiling in the swelter of the furnace room or wading\narmpit-deep in Paramite plop, that loincloth is the one thing standing\nbetween you and savage indecency, so you stick with it!

We recently announced at the Austrian\n“Baiting Imagination” Gaming Convention (ABIGCON) that we have already\nstarted work on a brand new title called Oddworld: Alf’s Concoction.\nIt’s kind of an online fabrication simulator where you have to make up\nas much stuff as possible.

The style was very similar to that used by the\nmudokons, and it got me wondering: was the graffiti was done by the same\nperson, or do grubs and muds frequent the same art classes?\n\n","answer":"Believe it or not, Mudokons and Grubbs outsource their rock art\nto the same company, nGravia.

Mudokon celebrations\nvary hugely, just like your own. They tend to align with natural events,\nlike the first day of spring when we can take off our winter loincloths,\nor the harvest of crops when we can stuff our faces again, rather than\nhaving institutionalized calendar days. That said, I’ve been campaigning\nfor a Tea Day for a few years now.\n"},{"question":"3. do mudokens ever play games? or are they workaholics?\n\n","answer":"Have you not met a Mudokon before?

CRIG! YOU’RE UP! I’m off\nto bed.\n\nAnyone ‘lucky’ enough to see Skillya is generally not going to\nleave her premises outside of a tin can. I’m certainly in no hurry to\npay her a visit, and I don’t think you’ll find anyone who is.

(only having one female to\nreproduce)\n\n","answer":"It’s the same as Mudokons, there are queens that handle all\nthe reproduction. Skillya is just one of several.\n"},{"question":"I know this might be the hard question to answer, but\nstay with me on this one… Sligs are one of my favourite characters, and\nI always wanted to know more about them. I’ve read on Oddworld wiki\nwebsites that they’re all raised by slig queen Skillya… But thats it. I\nalways wanted to know how they live in their barracks, what they do in\nfree time, how they pick jobs (Slig schools for guards, and pilots?),\nall that kind of stuff. Do they have ranks, maybe like slig officers?\n\n","answer":"Sligs don’t generally get to pick their own careers, they’re\ntreated as the property of the queens that lease them and the CEOs that\nrent them. Bosses might send their Sligs to be given training, or the\nSligs can pay for it themselves, but a Slig is rarely given any\neducation before being put to work. In our free time we like to play\ncards, gamble, hunt, and make life miserable for those under our\ncommand. That includes other Sligs.\n"},{"question":"Are there any other variations of Slig on Oddworld? We’ve got the\nbog standard walking Slig, flying, Big bro. Are there any paramedic\nSligs?\n\n","answer":"There are other variations. The snooty Slig Air Corps pilot\ncraft that make flying harnesses look like homemade crap. There are Slig\nTanks, mounted Sligs, Sloghandlers, anything there’s a market for. For\nall I know, there are Ninja Sligs, but I doubt it. Paramedic Sligs\nwouldn’t really serve any purpose. If you lose your units in combat,\njust buy some more for cheap.\n"},{"question":"How come RuptureFarms-sligs wear one-eyed masks, while\nSoulStorm-sligs wear two-eyed masks? Is that only a trend, different\nfrom place to place? Or an evolution of the masks?\n\n","answer":"The two-eyed masks are a newer, superior model. RuptureFarms\nwasn’t exactly known for its modern technology.\n"},{"question":"Also, will we ever see a real slig face without a mask?\n\n","answer":"Only if you’re very, very unlucky.\n"},{"question":"I was also wondering if slogs sometimes fight each other? For example,\nfor domination, when two alpha-leaders-slogs meet, just like\nalpha-scrabs. Or even, when someone throws one bone for two slogs.\n\n","answer":"Of course, that’s their natural way to maintain a social\norder. Fortunately, civilized society has developed advanced behavioural\ntraining techniques precision engineered to beat Slogs senseless into\nsubmission to Sligs and only Sligs. We can’t have guard animals turning\non one another when they should be turning on upstart slaves.\n"},{"question":"alf uh i wondered this, did the slogs originally kill sligs?\n\n","answer":"Sloghuts have staff casualties just like any other facility.\n"},{"question":"and crig, did you like your old boss mullock? he really bossed you\naround eh?

They gave Abe and Munch a funny feeling, so they pretty much tear\n'em up whenever they see one. The feather question is simply a result of\na traditional supply and demand scenario.\n"},{"question":"I forgot to mention in my other letter, in Munch's Odysee, the\ngood ending, When Lulu is betting or about to, a lot of clapping is\ngoing on.

Though shamefully tiny, useless and\nhidden, Glukkons DO have arms and hands. Also, Vykkers have double the\nappendages of the average Inhabitant, AND they are fierce clappers.

Has there been much\nchange in how the gameplay and enviornments have changed from six months\nago, and if so, what improvements were implimented?\n\n","answer":"Wow, six months ago… it seems like forever! One thing I can\nthink of that has changed is the ammo. It went through a lot of\nrevisions. It is a really important part of the game and we wanted it to\nbe exactly as we intended. It started out a little too cutesy for our\ntaste so we toughened it up a little, added the upgrades, and gave the\nplayer one infinite ammo, the Zappflies. You’ll used these to hunt other\nammo, and you can use them on enemies as well.\n"},{"question":"What prompted the change in title from \"Oddworld Stranger\"\nto \"Oddworld Stranger's Wrath\"?\n\n","answer":"A couple of things, really. First of all the previous naming\nconventions were a very specific pattern… Come on, say it with me now:\nOddworld, colon, character’s name, then insert clever word that\nrepresents a journey. Kinda predictable, so we decided we wanted to keep\nthe same “ring” to it and maintain that way of identifying with\nOddworld, but come a little closer to center without all the made-up\nspellings and such. On the other hand we got whiff of some other titles\nthat were similar to what we’d previously had in mind and preferred to\nnot cause any confusion. One thing Oddworld is not keen on is being\n“just like” anything else… so we sort of avoid that at all costs!\n"},{"question":"What kind of promotions are being planned for the game, such\nas advertising and other promotions as the release date draws nearer?\n\n","answer":"Well, first of all you may have noticed a brand new site at\nhttp://www.oddworld.ea.com. It’s a gorgeous piece, I must say, I really\nlike it. Also online, you’ll find great Oddworld features at\ngamespot.com and developer diaries at\nhttp://xbox.gamespy.com/xbox/oddworld-4/572191p1.html. A print ad has\nalso recently been in some recent pubs, like OXM. I’ve also been privy\nto some cool online promos, and of course, the crème de la crème, the\npiece de resistance, is that pre-order dvd. It is just awesome. I’m not\nbragging, really, it is just really cool, even as old Alfie, to see all\nthose Oddworld movies and random clips all in one place, together, where\nthey belong, on one handy-dandy dvd. Getting it all on there was no easy\ntask, and it is probably the most comprehensive Oddworld item we’ve ever\nput together. Well, since The Art of Oddworld Inhabitants (available at\nwww.ballisticpublishing.com). This is really an exciting time for us and\nfor the fans, with the book and the dvd being available just before the\nlaunch of Oddworld Stranger’s Wrath. It just seems like two things we’ve\nalways wanted have finally come to fruition… I hope that the fans enjoy\nit as much as us!\n"},{"question":"Where on Oddworld is this game set? Is it set on Mudos or on\nanother continent altogether?\n\n","answer":"The game takes place in Mudos but not in the same region that\nAbe and Munch are from. So you’ll see some familiar species, but for the\nmost part it is a whole new cast and location.\n"},{"question":"Relating to the above question, at what part of the Oddworld\ntimeline does the game take place? Is it set before/after the Abe/Munch\ngames, or in a totally different time period?\n\n","answer":"Wow, that is a great question. The story is really completely\nseparate, so the time, in relation to the Abe and Munch games is really\nsort of irrelevant. However, if we did put them in chronological order,\nfor whatever reason, I would say it is after. We haven’t ripped a hole\nin the fabric of time or anything.\n"},{"question":"Apart from the obvious FPS and action/adventure genres in\nthe game, the game appears to incorporate some elements of the RPG\ngentre \\[purchasing and upgrading of ammo, stores, talking to\ntownspeople, sidequests, etc\\]. What influenced these to be included in\nthe game and do you see Oddworld bringing other RPG elements into their\ngames or expanding on this in the future?\n\n","answer":"Fun. That’s it. We wanted this game to be fun, entertaining,\nenjoyable… on top of everything else. The upgrades add a lot to the\ngameplay experience, and our designers had a blast coming up with the\npurchasable items, as well as HOW they are purchased. I’m not sure what\nthe future holds, if that will become a bigger influence. We are always\ninterested in trying new and different things, so it may be. It would be\ngreat to incorporate some online elements in that way.\n"},{"question":"Stranger's Wrath production has been very secret. What are the\npros and cons of this for you?\n\n","answer":"It has its good points and its bad… I think there was more\ncreative freedom, but also the price of falling off the industry radar\nfor a while, not to mention our poor fans being kept in the proverbial\ndark. Things are picking up now though, and so far the strategy (if you\nwant to call it that) seems to have benefited us. I think it has created\na bit of a stir and some anticipation, and hopefully, if all goes well,\npeople will be pleasantly surprised with all we’ve packed into this\ngame. We think it’s worth the wait!\n"},{"question":"What innovations in the game do you think other developers\nwill follow?\n\n","answer":"In general, I guess we hope that all developers keep pushing\nthe capabilities of the hardware across the board, because everyone\nbenefits. Certainly innovation is constricted by time, but we still feel\nstrongly about what we’ve done with this engine. The camera has a really\ngood feel to it, and the transition between first and third person is\nsmooth. There’s a depth of field device that allows for some cool camera\neffects as well… these are some things you’ll likely be seeing more of\nin the future, from us and maybe other developers.\n"},{"question":"Overall, how much has Stranger stayed intact compared to\nbeginning of production?\n\n","answer":"Well, the story has been through many iterations, as well as\nsome of the features. But I think we’ve held true to what was most\nimportant to us, and that is the feel of the in-game cinematics, the\nquality of the CG, the entertainment value and the challenge of the\ngameplay and our wicked live ammo!\n"},{"question":"Who's your favorite new character appearing in Oddworld:\nStranger's Wrath?\n\n","answer":"I have to say it’s the Clakkerz. Particularily the females…\nit’s the first time we’ve had female characters in the game and frankly,\nI enjoy their sense of humor and admire their ability to offend in a\ncowardly, cranky sort of way.

Probably because it\nstimulates more senses than sight, you’ll want to shiver when you see\nit! BRRRR!!!!\n"},{"question":". Will the game have a \"bad ending\" like previous installations\nof the Oddworld series?\n\n","answer":"Nope, the end is the end is the end and that’s it.

This is my best\nattempt at luring you to get the game and play it to the end!\n"},{"question":"Oddworld games usually have a valuable message woven within\nthe story. Abe dealt with slavery and Munch with animal testing. What\nissue does Stranger deal with?\n\n","answer":"All of our characters deal with lots of issues, that is what\nmakes them compelling. Not to nit pick, but Abe and Munch were\nconfronted with slavery and animal testing, AND MORE! Stranger will also\ndeal with many issues.. I think the difference is that some of his are\nmore personal. But the big “theme issue” for this game is water\nprivatization. Sekto Springs Bottled Water Company has dammed the river\nto bottle water… and in the process damned the inhabitants that have\nrelied on it for centuries.\n"},{"question":"Stranger is the only guy to have a story separate from the\nQuintology. Do you know of any plans for another character besides\nStranger having this kind of setup?\n\n","answer":"I don’t know of any plans specifically, but I do know that when\nAbe was “born,” he was the only guy to have a story at that time. I\nthink in a nutshell, Lorne has lots of ideas and stories to share, and\nsome of them are a part of the Quintology… but others aren’t. There is\nmore to come for Stranger, and there are also more heroes to be born.\n"},{"question":"Will the game include any Cheat Codes or Easter Eggs? Possibly\nsecret Live Ammo? Personally, I think Fleeches would make an awesome\naddition to Stranger's arsenal.\n\n","answer":"Fleeches? Great, but messy! You see they slobber so much…..\nAnyway, if I told you there were Easter Eggs, they wouldn’t really be\nEaster Eggs anymore, now would they? Well maybe, but I need a clever way\nout of this question…\n"},{"question":"When watching a demo of Stranger on the Internet, it looked to\nme that the player would trigger checkpoints like in Halo. Is this true?\nWhat happened to Quicksave?\n\n","answer":"The game has quicksaves just like the previous Oddworld games.\nWe also do autosaves as you play through the game; this is just to help\nthe forgetful gamer who doesn't hit the save button very often - we\ndon't want them to have to replay the whole level when they die!\n"},{"question":"And one final question just for you. Are you going to make\nan appearance?\n\n","answer":"No, that stranger has his own dressing room, a personal\nassistant and gets a latte delivered every morning. I guess I’m sort of\nthe Hollywood has been of Oddworld.

Stranger’s a free Steef – just as much\nof a free bird as you are. We’re not just auctioning him off here – he’s\nno Mudokon slave. But if you’re asking about logistics of having a\nSteef’s child? It depends on a few things. Is it legal in your country\nto mate with a Steef? Must you be married first? And is your body\nequipped to hold a Steef embryo? What is the birthing process like for\nyour species hybridized with a Steef’s? These are some things to look\ninto. Check with your local Vykker for details.\n"},{"question":"Why are Sligs called Sligs and Glukkons called Glukkons?\n\n","answer":"A Slig is a Slig because it’s a Slig. And a Glukkon’s a Glukkon\nbecause it’s a Glukkon. You’re a Ricardo because that’s what Ricardos\nare, amirite? But would the beating of Slig feel so brutal if a Slig\nwent by any other name? Would Glukkons’ greed be so solipsistic if they\nweren’t called Glukkons? Would Meech Munchies be as delicious if we\ncalled them Fart Flurries? Is anybody listening?

Are there\nany water-based vehicles, like boats and stuff? I'd also like to know if\nI get to control that awe inspiring blimp I've seen pictures of?\n\n","answer":"We're still evaluating the role of vehicles in Munch's Oddysee.\n"},{"question":"Will the Munch's Oddysee environments be more Outside or Inside?\nWill there be more small buildings, like guard towers or little homes?\nOr large buildings, like factories and stations?\n\n","answer":"All of the above! We have massive, sprawling indoor\nenvironments, and we also have smaller guard towers and such dotting our\noutdoor landscapes. We're shooting for a balance of indoor and outdoor\nexperiences.\n"},{"question":"I would seriously like to know how large the worlds will be in\nMunch's Oddysee? Everquest size? Mario64?\n\n","answer":"We're still exploring the maximum sustainable size for our\noutdoor areas. We feel there isn't much point in having super-large\nareas if there isn't anything to do in them. There are trade-offs\ninvolved between the size of areas, the number of characters in those\nareas, the complexity of the environments, the presence of facilities,\netc. We haven't quite yet arrived at the magic formula that will let us\nanswer your question, but we're getting close!\n"},{"question":"Does Abe get any new tattoos in Munch's Oddysee? What about Munch,\nwill he get tattoos or any more electronic equipment?\n\n","answer":"Abe is a supporting character in Munch's Oddysee, and he\ndoesn't go on the sort of quest that awards new tattoos. Munch does\nevolve over the course of the story, but his evolution has more to do\nwith what he learns about himself and his race than any external change.\nTattoos aren't really Munch's thing, but you never know …\n"},{"question":"What is the utility of the thing that Munch has in his head?\n\n","answer":"The jack in Munch's head was installed by deranged Vykkers\nscientists for twisted reasons of their own. Little did they realize\nthat Munch would find a way to use his jack to control robots, vehicles,\nand other machines.\n"},{"question":"I heard that Mullock is coming back in Munch's Oddysee and that you\nvisit Rupture Farms…is this true?\n\n","answer":"I can neither confirm nor deny a role for Mollock in Munch's\nOddysee. A return to RuptureFarms does presently figure in the game.\n"},{"question":"Will Bigface appear in Munch's Oddysee? Will Abe disappear in the\nnext game (Munch's Exoddus)?\n\n","answer":"Because this story is about Munch, Big Face does not appear\n(Bigface is Abe's mentor). In many ways, Abe has moved beyond what Big\nFace can teach him, which is one of the reasons the Almighty Raisin\nchooses this time to reveal himself to our heroes. And don't worry –\nAbe's story is far from over. He isn't going anywhere soon.\n"},{"question":"The Glukkon Queen Margaret is the absolute ruler.  \nThe Slig Queen Skillya is a wealthy business partner of the Glukkons.  \nThe Glukkons make up the rich business class.  \nThe Vykkers make up the rich tech class.  \n?????????????????  \nThe Sligs make up the low paid soldier/police class.  \nThe Mudokons make up the slave laborer class.  \nSlogs and Fleeches are pets.  \nMeetles are beasts of burden.  \nScrabs, Paramites, and Meeches are livestock.  \nThis is Oddworld's modern society as I've been able to piece together.\nNotice the blank space? That's where a working middle class would be.\nWho are they?\n\n","answer":"An interesting evaluation, and largely accurate. Most of the\nworking class that you mention live in Oddworld's cities, which have yet\nto be seen … and those details will have to wait for a future game.\n\nYou should also realize that the classes you mention aren't monolithic.\nThat is to say, while the majority of Sligs are part of a low paid\nsoldier class, there are also middle-class Sligs.\n\nLikewise, not all Mudokons are slaves. Additionally, there are internal\nmarkets in each of the classes you mention … just because many Mudokons\nare part of a slave class doesn't mean they aren't enthusiastic\nconsumers of Paramite Pies.\n\nEven Mudokon slaves have some discretionary bonus income to spend\n(earned for meeting production quotas, or snitching out their fellow\nslaves).\n"},{"question":"With businesses such as Rupture Farms and Soul Storm Brew, who\nexactly do the $$$-hungry Glukkons sell these products to?\n\n","answer":"Anyone and everyone! The Magog Cartel is always looking for new\nmarkets to exploit.\n"},{"question":"In Munch's Oddysee, will you show the different forms of Mudokons?\nOr Sligs in their many stages of life?\n\n","answer":"You will certainly see a new twist on Sligs. We're still\nworking on some surprises for Mudokons.\n"},{"question":"How come Sligs and Glukkons never come close to the Scrabs,\nParamites, or Fleeches, even just by chance? I would want to see the\noutcome if they did…\n\n","answer":"In our first two games, this was entirely due to memory\nconstraints on the Playstation. Our characters are so rich and so\ndetailed that you can't have more than a few of them on screen at the\nsame time. We really had to jump through hoops to get as much stuff on\nthe screen as we did … every time you move from one screen to the next,\nthe code is busily swapping stuff in and out in the background. It's\nalmost like pouring water from a gallon jug, into a cup, then into\nanother gallon jug, over and over again, without spilling a drop in the\nmeantime. Quite a challenge!\n\nWe trust that our new platform will permit us to work with a broader\ncanvas of characters, although machines being what they are, I'm sure\nwe'll still be doing all sorts of wizardry in the background to deliver\nthe most exciting game experience possible.\n"},{"question":"How did the Sligs get their pants? Did they build them themselves,\nor did the Glukkons make them? (and if the Glukkons did, they would have\nto sit a bit away from the work area because the length of their arms,\nwouldn't they?)\n\n","answer":"Most of the weird technology you see on Oddworld is derived,\ndirectly or indirectly, from the twisted experiments at Vykkers Labs.\n"},{"question":"If the Glukkons (or Sligs) can make pants for the Sligs, then why\ndon't they make pants for themselves?\n\n","answer":"Please! No self-respecting Glukkon would be caught dead\ntottering about on a gauche set of mechanical legs!\n"},{"question":"I was wondering, since Sligs are first born with an urge to nurture\nand this instinct is later beaten out of them, is there a chance that we\nwill ever encounter “nice” Sligs?\n\n","answer":"Nice tendencies are ruthlessly sought out and eliminated in\nSligs at a very early age … but you never know. A grub here or there\nmight slip through the system.\n"},{"question":"Alf, do you play a role in Munch's Oddysee?\n\n","answer":"I'll be all around in the dark. I'll be everywhere, wherever\nyou can look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be\nthere. Wherever there's a Slig beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be\nin the way guys yell when they're mad. I'll be in the way kids laugh\nwhen they're hungry and they know supper's ready and where people are\neatin' the stuff they raise and livin' in the houses they build. I'll be\nthere, too.\n"},{"question":"I was wondering why Abe was the chosen one to help free all the\nMudokens?…I mean he's really clumsy and stupid.\n\n","answer":"Odd works in mysterious ways.\n"},{"question":"In Munch's Oddysee, in the Vykkers labs can the player interact\nwith all the specimens in the cages that the Vykkers are experimenting\non (i.e. let them out and make them attack Sligs, etc.)?\n\n","answer":"Munch can build a little army with all the Fuzzles he releases\nin Vykkers Labs.\n"},{"question":"In Munch's Oddysee, will Abe and the various other characters have\nan extended “Gamespeak?” Will Abe also have different Mystical Tattoos?\nIf so, what do they do?\n\n","answer":"GameSpeak has been both extended and simplified for Munch's\nOddysee, and plays a pivotal role in the game.\n"},{"question":"What does SoulStorm Brew taste like?\n\n","answer":"Don't ask me about Brew! I'm still tryin' to forget! Man, one\nis too many, and a million's not enough!\n"},{"question":"I remember a guardian angel in an FMV for the first game. It also\nappears now in the Oddworld Universe section of the website. What\nrelevance does it have to the game? Will the guardian angel appear in\nMunch's Oddysee?\n\n","answer":"The Shrink, as he is now known, was originally part of an early\nconcept for a television ad for Abe's Oddysee. Nothing goes to waste\nhere at Oddworld, so I'm sure you'll see the Shrink in a game sooner or\nlater.\n"},{"question":"I was wondering, in some of the Abe's Exoddus pictures with the\nMudokons hanging upside down on the ‘tear thing', their loin clothes are\nstaying up? How can that be?\n\n","answer":"Censor's Glue. It's the same thing that keeps Xena's skirt in\nplace.\n"},{"question":"After the 5th game of the Oddworld Quintology, will there be\nsomething else in store for us Oddworld fans, or is that the end\nforever?\n\n","answer":"I'm sure we'll continue to make Oddworld games as long as we\ndraw breath (provided they put work stations in rest homes and insane\nasylums).\n"},{"question":"I heard that Oddworld Inhabitants will make a Squeek's Oddysee.\nWhat can you tell me about it?\n\n","answer":"Only that it is indeed scheduled to be a Quintology title, and\nthat it's top secret.\n"},{"question":"What happened to the Oddworld store with all the cool Oddworld\nMerchandise?\n\n","answer":"Unfortunately our store had to close due to our change of\npublishers.

I'll assume Glukkons and Vykkers\ngo somewhere to get an education, yes?\n\n","answer":"Glukkons take a lot of correspondence courses, and I think\nVykkers learn about science by sending away for chemistry sets\nadvertised in the backs of old comic books. Or maybe they have sprawling\nuniversities and business schools. I can't really say. I've never been\ninside a Glukkon city to take a peek.\n"},{"question":"Haven't any of the Mudokons taken time to get to know a Slig? You\nnever know, Sligs could be warm on the inside and have a bitter outside\nbecause of their BS with Molluck. Besides, isn't what you Mudokons are\ndoing called \"racism?\"\n\n","answer":"Probably more like \"species-ism.\" The only Sligs I've gotten to\nknow very well were the slugs that kept hitting me with gun butts, but\nyou're right, maybe they're decent guys under all that psychopathic\nbravado. It's not their fault that they have to shoot guys in the back.\nYeah, I blame society.\n"},{"question":"Hey, you told me that in Munch's Oddysee Abe and Munch can take\nmore than one shot from a Slig's rifle. This seems like a good idea, but\nI wanted to make sure that you were keeping it realistic. In MO will Abe\nand Munch be able to keep walking after being shot seven times like in\nmany FPS games available on the market?\n\n","answer":"We're still tuning the damage values of our characters. We're\naiming for a sweet spot between \"bang, you're dead\" and \"bullets bounce\nlike tennis balls.\" Whatever we select, it will fit into the whole like\nany other Oddworld mechanic.\n"},{"question":"What would one have to do to get an oddworld.com e-mail address?\n\n","answer":"Get a job with Oddworld Inhabitants.\n"},{"question":"On the Oddworld site, they say Molluck the Glukkon is seeking his\nway to the top again . . . but I thought he was dead in the end of Abe's\nOddysee?\n\n","answer":"You can't keep a good Glukkon down!\n"},{"question":"Can Abe Swim?\n\n","answer":"I dunno. Is flailing your arms around and screaming real loud\nconsidered \"swimming?\"\n"},{"question":"As far as the Mudos know, possession is 9/10ths of the law. In\nMunch's Oddysee will we be able to possess anything with a brain, like\nall of the funky temple guards & what-have-you, or will there be\nrestrictions on some of them, like mental shielding?\n\n","answer":"As in past games, there will be some things you can possess,\nand some things that you can't. The criteria for what you can possess\nhas a lot to do with the intellect of the target. There has to be some\nminimum degree of intelligence in anything you possess.\n"},{"question":"In Abe's Exoddus, why doesn't Abe have the tattoos on his hands?\n\n","answer":"The stickers must have washed off in the bath.\n"},{"question":"How many different types of weapons will there be in Munch's\nOddysee?\n\n","answer":"I'm not sure what the official count is, right now, but there\nwill be plenty, and all of them hurt. The bad guys have their usual\nassortment of guns, and the heavy armament packed by Big Bro Sligs\nreally stings. The good guys get some help this time around, in the form\nof unique Spooce Weapons: bows, tomahawks, and more.

Will there ever be a game where you can play\nmultiplayer/co-operative?\n\nWell I hope you reply. Thanx\n\n","answer":"Well, first of all there will be plenty of connections to the\nold games in Oddworld Stranger's Wrath. You are definitely going to know\nthat this is an Oddworld game. Just because Abe and Munch are MIA\ndoesn't mean we aren't us. Trust me, that makes sense if you think about\nit! What could be more odd than the stranger I ask you????

Of course\nthey are meaner than all get out and you should avoid them at all costs.\nAnd did I mention that they're ugly? Cuz they are. Outlaws are, well,\njust kind of what they sound like.

With the game coming out next month\nyou'd think people would be dying to know.

Anyway, I thought to myself, \"What would be better right now\nthan a Meech Munchie?\" I went down to the store and I hear that they are\nextint! So I asked them for a Paramite Pie, but they were all out. I\ndidn't know what else there was, so I just went home, but when I got\nthere the \"Travels\" were over. So my question comes in two parts: \\#1\nCan you give me a list of all those tasty, delectable treats (some\npictures whould be nice too) so I can properly decide what I can get at\nthe store, and so I don't miss my shows. and \\#2 Is it healthy to leave\nmy TV alone for so long like that? I swear those 20 minutes were one of\nthe most horrifing moments in all my life. Sincerly,  \nChris \"Hungry and Scared\"\n\n","answer":"Dear Chris, You are in luck my friend!

The answer to the other, more\nsuperfluous question is no. Phleg does not have acromegaly. He just has\na severe case of egostroke-e-osis. Oh yes. That, my fellow buds, is what\nI call linquistics in action.\n"}],"dear-alf-april-2011-volume-1":[{"question":"I have a question that’s been bugging me ever since I was a kid,\nhow did Abe learn to chant in Rupterfarms when he was born into\nslavery?\n\n","answer":"First of all, Abe is not scary! He’s the least imposing,\nfriendliest Mud you’re likely to bump into! Unless of course you’re a\nfactory owner or corporate security lackey. Then I suppose Abe’s chant\nbecomes something you should fear, yes. Also, thank you to Zach for\nsending me the same question no fewer than four times over the last two\nweeks!\n\nSomething you may not realize is that most of the Mudokons in\nRuptureFarms learnt to chant. You can’t not! It’s just that most of us\nare chanting “Mercy! Mercy!” or “Rest, please! Rest, please!” in\nresponse to Slig brutality. Abe’s chant was “No! No! No! No!”. Then one\nday he was so hungry he ate an old Elum Chub he found in a trash can and\nwent on a serious trip. Next thing we knew, he was clutching in stomach,\nchanting in agony, and all these sparkles were floating around him. We\nthought his trip must have become airborne!\n"},{"question":"Hey Alf, what exactly do you Mudokons recite when chanting?\n\n","answer":"It’s not anything but a sound. A very important, powerful sound\nthat brings us closer to the spirit world, but just a sound. Not words.\nIf you had to transcribe it, maybe it could go “Nyahnyahnyahnyah” or\nsomething?

Besides that Tell Abe I say\nWassup:)\n\n","answer":"Not me personally, they haven’t, nor any Mud I’ve ever met. The\nruthless lands around the Mongo River are quite a long way from here.\nBut sure, Outlaws will stoop to all manner of foul deed, including\npestering innocent Grubbs and Mudokons.\n"},{"question":"Hello Alf, I was wondering what its like to hang out with the\nGrubbs. Can you tell me? They have a good sense of humor. Also, have you\never had any Outlaw patients in your rehab?\n\n","answer":"Grubbs are super friendly folks once you have their trust, but\nthey’re massively suspicious of outsiders. Can’t blame them with all the\nflooding and drought and displacement and poverty and slavery and\nbadgering and prosecution and genocide that’s been heaped upon them by\nSekto and Wolvarks and Outlaws and Clakkerz. Personally, I reckon their\nreliance on the Steef led to their passive and weedy nature, but all\nprops to them, they knew how to hold an uprising when the time was\nright.\n\nI’ve never had an Outlaw in my rehab. They’d be welcome, albeit under\nclose scrutiny, but they just don’t care about their health that much.\n"},{"question":"Alf (forgive me if I haven’t been doing my homework),\npresumably Mudokon eggs very rarely hatch into females, which slowly\nswell up into giant slug ladies with oozing breasts.

Who are the Glukkon eggs raised by, and what facilities are there\nto care for any species of young queen that may happen to hatch? Things\ncould get awkward with giant oozing-breast slug ladies cramping the\nplace up.\n\n","answer":"They’d certainly notice. Sam is a — shall we say — fecund\nmomma, but ultimately she’s not going to be a reliable source of slave\nlabor for long. For all we know, she could be willfully withholding any\nfemale offspring. We don’t exactly get taught Mudokon biology in\nnursery. Our eggs are shipped to factories where we’re hatched and given\na broom or pickaxe and left to slave for our survival.

So here it is...\nJapan has a strict discriminating policy against any simulated\ncharacters entering their country with four fingers. Historically, Japan\nhas had a subclass of meatpacking workers that were typically looked\ndown upon in their society. In later days, the blatant displaying of a\nfour-fingered hand gesture, intentionally directed at another, came to\nmean that you were calling them a member of the meatpacking subclass.\nWhich, we understand, was not at all a compliment.\n\nIt appears that the four finger connection with the meat packing class\nwas due to work-related accidents, but was so frequent that it came to\nsymbolically represent the sub-class. It seems as though this is a part\nof the Japanese history that some groups within Japan would like to see\nforgotten. Therefore, it is at great risk that you publish four-fingered\ncharacters in Japan, as you may very likely end up in legal battles with\na vociferous pressure group. This group claims that this type of\nrepresentation is equivalent to and as degrading as the yellow star\nforced to be worn on Jews by the Nazi's during the Second World War.That\nis, it's offensive and degrading unless they can extort enough money out\nof you. Then it's all okay. Case in point: We were told that the Walt\nDisney Corporation is charged five million dollars a year by this group\nso that Mickey Mouse may live in Japan and retain his original four\nfingered design. Otherwise, old Mickey would need to see a surgeon and\nhave something done about that insulting forth finger.\n\nThe moral of this story is... if you want to pay, then it's ok. If you\ndon't want to pay, then it's a horrible insult to our culture. In other\nparts of the world, we have a word for these types of two-faced tactics.\nWe call it extortion. If it is truly offensive and degrading, then don't\nallow it at all. But to allow it for a price... is to belittle the case\naltogether. It suggests that the real truth behind these groups is that\nthey are using the darker moments in their own cultures' history as an\nexcuse to coerce money out of content providers.\n\nWell, being that this is Oddworld, we felt that this seemed like a\nperfect addition to the Abe story. We thought it was ironically perfect\nthat he was being discriminated against for being who he was. As the\nmessage came from Japan, \"They don't like his kind here,” with the\nsincere suggestion, \"Just chop off one of his fingers cause you don't\nhave the money to pay up...\" caused us to feel that we indeed needed to\nallow Abe to go through the suffering that goes along with being a poor\nslob at the bottom of the Food chain. Yup, we chopped off his finger so\nthat the Japanese wouldn't get offended (or paid). He didn't like it one\nbit, but due to the fact that there ain't much he can do about it... we\ndecided that he could donate his finger rather than us donating five\nmillion dollars. Such is life in Japan when you’re a four-fingered\nmeatpacking worker.\n\nAnd that is how Abe lost his finger in Japan. He's still pretty pissed\noff about it, but we convinced him that with the amount of games sold in\nJapan, he still might be able to get his message through to their\nculture someday. As a true believer in his cause, he felt that the\nsacrifice of a finger was but a small price to pay in hoping to shed\nsome light on discriminations and injustices the world over.\n"},{"question":"Can you tell me what Lorne Lanning’s email address is so I can\nwrite him?\n\n","answer":"No, we really can’t give that out.

But with\nno one around to beat us we got chattin’, complaining about the noise of\nthe heavy machinery. Abe thought it would be rad to do an impression of\nthe meat saws spinning—it was rubbish!

And as a\nresult, how did Uncle Aslik find out about fun with farts if regular\nmudokons can’t do it (they just get sick) to write the tourist tips\nabout it in Feeco Depot?\n\n","answer":"Oh trust me, it happens. Many valuable company assets are lost\nto the dangerous gas that drink gives ya.

I studyed every peice of\ninformation I could find. I memorized the history of Oddworld. I\ncompleted both games with a perfect score after practice. I absorbed\nevery faset of the concept and every nich. I downloaded every film and\nwatched them over and over again. I am an artist and nothing in the past\nconnected to me that way. It shifted my entire approch.\n\nI watched with starving eyes every drawing and every detail that was\nreleased on Munch's Oddysee as they were put up. I was a fanatical with\nthe concept and story of Oddworld. Now I feel sick. The one company and\nthe one artistic vision that stood out and built me up with longing for\nmore let me down. Now Oddworld has stooped to the level Ninja Turtels or\nlower. Sam, the thing I most anticipated, is no longer a part of the\ngame.\n\nAnd Sobe. Why SoBe? This advertizement has destroyed the integrity of\nOddworld. They are no long real torchered, heroic, and pathetic entitys\nthrough the minds eye. They are now simply a cheap video game.

Absolutely love the games and everything about them and in them.\n\nI just downloaded the new Munch trailer, you know, the one in the\nbeginning where a Mudokon farts and Abe says, \"Dude, that's nasty.\" LOL.\nThat trailer was hilarious and Slig-kickin' AWESOME all at once! Just\nseeing everything alive and moving in the new 3D world has made me\nunable to wait for Munch's Oddysee!\n\n45 days left until Xbox and, the best part of all...ODDWORLD!!!\nYEAH!!!\n\nOn that Thursday, this is my plan:\n\n1. Stay home from school and beat both Oddworlds again\n\n2. Go to Best Buy at 10:00pm and wait in the Xbox line\n\n3.

Then, last of all, hook up the Xbox and play Oddworld all night and\ninto the next day.\n\nThat is a very tight and risky schedule but hey, in the end it's all\nworth it.

I'm acting like it is going to come out tomorrow but, NO, not\nuntil Nov. 15th! AAAHHHHHHH!

I've proselytized far and wide about the\nvirtues to both Abe games. When Munch jumped ship to Xbox from PS2,\nwhile saddened that I would have to wait longer for the next game in the\nquintology, I remained steadfast in my belief that whatever was done\nwould be for the benefit of the game and would only make the final\nproduct better.\n\nLately though, I have been getting progressively more worried. The\nfinal straw, as it were, was the inclusion of Munch as a visualization\nin Windows Media Player and the shameless plug for Microsoft Plus on the\nOddworld website. With so many blatant Microsoft-appeasing actions of\nthis type appearing in connection with Oddworld, I have finally had to\nacknowledge Oddworld Inhabitants as an unabashed sellout.\n\nSo my question comes down to this: How can Oddworld Inhabitants\njustify to me, one of their die-hard fans, their sellout? This isn't a\nPS2 vs. Xbox issue. This is a monopoly issue. This is about becoming\nthat which the games themselves regard as the ultimate evil. The\nOddworld games are fundamentally built around anti-corporate ideals.\nAbe, Munch, and their brethren represent the little people who are\ncrushed under the vast corporate machine. How can you, Oddworld\nInhabitants, expect us to feel compassion and connection to the travails\nof these characters when you yourselves have become part of that\nterrible corporate machine? I appreciate the need for development\nmoolah. I'm not stupid. I work in the CG world as well. It's cutthroat\nout there, especially now. But you seem to have been doing fine when you\nwere your own company. You cited better equipment as your reason for\nswitching to Xbox, not a massive Microsoft bribe. How can you be such\nblatant hypocrites?\n\nI really want an answer to this. And I don't want any corporate\nrhetoric either. I want a real answer as to why I should accept the\nanti-corporate message of the Oddworld games even though the makers\nthemselves are Glukkons.\n\nWith waning hope, --Coby\n\n","answer":"Oddworld ain't anti-corporate, first of all. Oddworld's a\nbusiness, and just like any other, to make our product, we rely on\npeople buying them and then we use that money to pay the scrubs in the\npens to crank out code and art and design. When we were asked to be part\nof the Plus! visualization we were excited that millions of people would\nbe able to enjoy Munch too.

Oh, it can be done with a lot of\nplanning, but an ever-growing proportion of free Muds are too busy\ncelebrating life to give half a care to organizing rebellion.

There are far more reproductive models that you’ll\nlearn about as we introduce new species. Paramites have Queens, they sit\nginormously in the nests. Female Scrabs form herds with the leader being\nthe ‘Queen’, while the males are expelled and left to fend for\nthemselves.

I\nknow that they are killing machines, but are they used to be tame and\nnice creatures before they got to the Sligs?\n\n","answer":"I’ve heard some of the eldest shamans talk about Slogs like\nthey could be tender, loving lifelong companions. I’ve also heard them\ntalk about how tasty boiled grodwort is, so they’re clearly not to be\ntrusted.\n"},{"question":"and finally there are humans in oddworld?\n\n","answer":"I sure hope not!

I could\nimagine the Glukkons trying to capitalize on Mudokons again by making\ntea out of, I don't know, Mudokon dandruff flakes or something\n\n","answer":"I do make my own tea, but I most certainly do not use dandruff\nunless I've really run out of other ingredients.\n"},{"question":"If you're there to help other Muds forget their traumatic\nexperiences and heal them, who was their to help and heal you?\n\n","answer":"It's not about making the forget, it's about making them come\nto terms with it and getting on their lives as healthier, stronger\nMudokons.

A Slig or an Outlaw?\n\n","answer":"I hate to suggest that an Outlaw is smart, but they at least\nhave survival skills. Out there in the lawless stretches of Western\nMudos they need to have their wits about them to survive. True they\nleech of Clakkerz and Grubbs, but that itself isn't an /unwise/\ndecision.

Outlaws believe in\nsurvival and power over hygeine. By calling Stranger pretty they're\ncalling into question his strength and hence his ability to prevail in\ncombat.

Only way you can do\nit and survive is to pay them.\n"},{"question":"Will Munch HD have stuff that was cut out of the original game?\n\n","answer":"Munch's Oddysee IS the original game, and Munch HD will be the\nHD version of it. It would be harder than popping a Slig's buttzit to\nadd new content with the outdated pipeline that game used, and it would\nonly improve the game in a sentimental way. Not that sentiment is bad,\nbut we have to prioritize! You can't paint your Rehab before you've\nbuilt its walls!\n"},{"question":"Why doesn't anyone push down a Glukkon?\n\n","answer":"Because nobody fancies spending the rest of their short lives\nin solitary confinement undergoing torture.\n"},{"question":"Do Slogs lay eggs like the Mudokon queen?\n\n","answer":"No, no one lays eggs quite like the Mudokon queen.

It's a small\nbag... is it like a bottomless bag with a vacuum in it?\n\n","answer":"It's a can. Ocassionally the canning factories glitch and put\nhuge amounts of negative pressure where they should be doing the\nopposite. If you know exactly what to look for, if you know how to tap\nit just right, you can find cans just like it in stores across Oddworld.\n"},{"question":"Is it true that Oddworld is going to head in a lighter direction?\n\n","answer":"Nonsense.

Sligs don’t have legs!! Do ya expect us\nto teeter on top of ’em? Where would we stick the tubes?? And I’ve no\nidea how you think phat-fueled robot limbs might be considered\ndecorative. Maybe we’d unscrew the kneecaps and hang them on the wall\nlike miniature shields. Or turn ’em upside down and use the legs like a\ncoat stand. Whaddya reckon?

What’s powering the ropes? Beats me! They go off in loadsa\ndirections and into tiny holes, but if it’s like typical ancient Mudokon\ntechnology it’s powered by the flow of wind, water or spiritual energy.\n"},{"question":"How could all those slogs fit in a tiny slog hut.\n\n","answer":"There ain’t a single labor law covering ’employment’ of\nMudokons out here.

What did your keyboard pressin’\ngods of game development mess up there?? It’s in all versions I played\nso far (PS1, PC, PS3)! And where’s the patch for that bug in this\nawesome game? ;)\n\n","answer":"The Magog Sign Company never thought it would be needed. Put it\nthis way: when you’ve got nearly a hundred workers, you might expect a\ncouple to escape. It’s important to know that, so you can recapture or\nreplace them. But you’ve still got nearly a hundred workers! No biggie\nif that number doesn’t change. If you’re asking if the Glukkons were\nwoefully underprepared for Abe coming up and freeing every last one of\nthem, then the answer is yes! I only hope they don’t go too far now they\nknow what a single Mudokon can be capable of.\n"},{"question":"Have you ever had a run in with a snoozer?\n\n","answer":"If you mean Snoozer as in the giant, three-legged robotic\nnursemaid with tranquilizer turrets, then no.

It's about Mud's hands.\nThey are huge compared to your bodies. I am willing to bet they weigh\ntwenty-five pounds, and could be used to club Glukkon's brains out. I\nmean, they are giant. You could guide aircraft with them. I'm surprised\nthat you aren't weighed down with them. My question: Why? Why do you\nneed such abnormally large hands? -Kathleen\n\n","answer":"To cuddle my abnormally large fuzzle at night.

The caliper and test-tube motif for the Oddworld logo was created\nfor a brochure for the 1999 E3 convention. At the time, we were working\non two games simultaneously; Munch's Oddysee and Hand of Odd. As time\nwent on and the gears of corporate commerce kept turning, Hand of Odd\nfaded away and Munch's Oddysee became the sole focus of production.

But then when all those baby Gabbits\nstart asking 'Where did we come from?' he either has to make something\nup, or else say \"Well, a can, actually.\" Even if Munch had somebody to\nask, I think he'd be afraid to for getting a similar answer.\n"},{"question":"Where did you get the name Exoddus from?

It's o.k. if you don't know.\n\n","answer":"I'm glad you gave me that out there at the end; I was gonna be\nhaving major fits of introspection about my self-worth if I got this\nwrong. At a guess, I'm gonna say it looks round and bumpy. With, you\nknow, bits of blue, brown, and green spots, like an overripe Spooce\nShrub or something. Fact is, I don't know. You gotta get pretty far away\nfrom a planet to be able to tell what it looks like.

In this magazine article I saw a \"Slig Health\nchart\" that showed increasing amounts ofinjury like casts and crutches\nand stuff. In the same article there was also a \"Slig Status Chart\"\nwhere a slig was shown with increasing amounts of armor and firepower.\nAlso, the article quoted Lorne Lanning talking about socially contorted\nGameSpeak, where a mid-status creature would speak insultingly to his\ninferiors, normally to his equals, and subserviently to his superiors.\nDid all this awesome stuff make it into the game?!\n\n","answer":"Hey yeah, I saw some of those sligs walkin' around in\nwierd-lookin' suits of platemail... I thought they were having a Ren\nFest or something. Don't count on seeing any slig in a cast, though. A\nslig in a cast is a slig on sick leave, and a slig on sick leave is a\nliability that his boss would just as soon recycle as let heal.\n\nAnd if you want socially contorted gamespeak, step on down to my little\nrehab center sometime.

For instance, say Abe wandered where he shouldn't again\nand was shot. Even if he's only holding onto life by a thread, will he\nstill be able to run and jump at his maximum potential, or will he be\nforced to hobble around at a horrendously reduced speed? Just\nwondering.\n\n","answer":"That's one of the things that didn't make the cut for this\ngame. Look for some kind of visible damage in Munch 2. We have really\ncool concept art on one or our conference room walls. Right now, the\nthinking in the designers' dungeon is that slowing down abe or munch\nwhen they hurt isn't much fun, but they've changed their minds before...\n"},{"question":"Helloooooooo!

Glukkons think they're smart, cause they get most of the\nMoolah and the good cigars.

Poor guy, I couldn’t stand to have that much on my\nconscience.\n"},{"question":"How do Spoocebows compare to Slig rifles?\n\n","answer":"Well they use renewable resources, aren’t used to subjugate\npeople, and their trade doesn’t sponsor slavery and oppression, so they\ncompare favorably in the ethical category.\n"},{"question":"So I was wondering, if you had to join one of the\ntribe’s which would it be? The Mudomo, The Mudanchee, or the Fleech\ntribe? (the name was never given but one of the stinky dead guys had a\nspecific headdress for the fleeches)\n\n","answer":"An interesting question, and for the purpose of giving an\ninteresting answer I’m going to pretend they’re not all extinct. See now\nthe Scrab is pretty good at getting things done: he tackles his problems\nhead-on and doesn’t respond to silly, annoying questions with anything\nbut a head-lowered, beak-extended charge attack. I like his style. But\nParamites are easier to get along with, and as a fan liaison I need that\nimage. So I think Mudomo is my answer. I’m not even gonna consider\nFleeches. What’s wrong with you?\n"},{"question":"Who writes the Daily Deception newspaper?\n\n","answer":"The Daily Deception staff. They employ the greatest paparazzi,\npropagandists, phone hackers and ink slingers to write exactly what will\ninfluence the masses in the way they want. The power of the news is to\ngrab your attention with provocative headlines, report only what they\nwant you to know and believe, and pretend anything counter to that\ndoesn’t exist. I’ve had this argument with Crig too many times.\n"},{"question":"do mudokkons have sexual organs\n\n","answer":"The queens and the drones do, but not us workers. We don’t need\n’em. Too busy working. Now where’s my hackey sack?\n"},{"question":"Ey there Alf I was just wondering. Why is Abe immune to\nsoul storm brew sickness\n\n","answer":"You didn’t see the state he was in when he got back from\nSoulStorm Brewery. Trust me, he might have farted as much of that\nbadness out as he could Mudokonly manage, but no one drinks Brew and\ngets away with it. He spent a long time in my Rehab recuperating, and\nI’ve got the boring memories to prove it.\n"},{"question":"also how do the glukkons ground up Mudockon bones to a liquid well\nTata\n\n","answer":"Excuse me, I need to go and put my head into a bowl for a\nwhile.

What do you think, folks?\n"},{"question":"Is Sam a monotreme? (Egg-laying mammal)\n\n","answer":"It doesn’t make a whole heap of sense to use fancy words like\nthat round these parts. Life on Oddworld evolved on Oddworld, quite\nseparate from the categories you’re familiar with. Sure there are\nresemblances that you’ll recognize, but Mudokons can’t really be\ndescribed as mammals. We did, after all, evolve from birds – hence our\nfeathery hair. But Sam lays eggs, yeah.\n"},{"question":"How good or bad does Stranger deal with not being able to socialize in\na herd of his own kind?\n\n","answer":"If he’s anything like most other species, badly. Mudokons,\nGrubbs, Gabbits, Sligs all of us are incredible social. Of course, he\ncould be like an Elum. Elums get on perfectly well in groups but they\nalso have no problem being on their own for indefinate stretches. It’s\njust another form of their hardiness. Or maybe he’s like a dominant\nScrab and he can’t stand to be with others of his kind. Why are you even\nasking me? Go ask him!\n"},{"question":"Hi Alf, will you appear more often in the HD remakes ?

In Abe's Oddysee the Sligs had a\nvisor sort of thing going across their face, and in Exoddus they have\nproper eyes.

Sligs began walking off high ledges and stumbling into\nbone-crunching machinery more and more often.

The limb replacements are\njust to get better limbs than those that they had. Vykkers, like\nGlukkons, don't take very good care of their bodies, and need constant\nreplacement parts. As for profession, Vykkers aren't all doctors,\nthey're all researchers. Some do medical research, finding new uses for\nhelpless animals, or new addictive substances to add to the food.

If you don't get paid, you\ncan't buy more ammo, or gas for your pants. (Did you know these pants\nare gas powered?) And if there's one thing every slig learns, it's don't\nget caught without pants or ammo. We all just love to beat on the dopes\nwho do, and even mudokons will sometimes beat up a pantsless slig.

I was working an outside patrol back then, and I spotted Abe\none night. He was too far to shoot, and I would have just left him, but\nthere was a reward, and I really wanted that new BlastMaster 350\ndual-barrel alternating machine rifle.

I know they tend to disappear after birth, but thought I’d ask\nanyways.\n\n","answer":"I haven’t come across any weird-lookin’ Sligs. Trust me, after\ndishing out the healthy overdose of taunting and bludgeoning they have\ncoming to ’em, I’d remember! We have a reputation to maintain: We’re\nruthless, heartless security jerks, here to stomp on upstart slaves and\nkeep out self-righteous rebels. Every Slig has been through a\nnightmarish selection process to ensure only the finest, fittest,\nfightingest specimens make it to factory floors. There’s no room for\ngenetic setbacks or standout non-conformists. An albino Slig would be a\nthreat to the financial security of Sligdom and should be teased\nmercilessly.\n"},{"question":"I heard of an earthling monster called “Cthulu”\nwhich is like a giant (AND I MEAN GIANT) Slig that has wings, scales,\nand is much, much worse.\n\n","answer":"Probably the result of some twisted Vykker experiment. The\nthings they can do with GM steroids and a tube of supposterone would\nleave you speechless. Gonna assume you don’t mean mechanical wings, so\nwho knows where they come from. Probably a casual bit of limb-splicing\nfrom a Flying Scrab. All in a day’s leisure time for them, and then it’s\ntime for their real work. They’re disturbing and frightening. I’ve\nsigned up for some of their experimental arm-regrownanism. Maybe I’ll\nget a wing and be able to fly in circles.\n"},{"question":"the slig in love?\n\n","answer":"Love? Where is that?

I have read in your previous FAQs that Grubbs and\nMudokons are not related at all, and do not follow the same evolutionary\npath. I’ve also read that the Gabbits (used to) spawn in the Mongo River\nin Western Mudos, where the Grubbs live. Are Gabbits and Grubbs related?\nIf not, did they in the same region or villages?\n\n","answer":"They’re not related, just like you’re not related to fish\n(unless my audience has changed drastically in the last few months), but\nthey do have a fascinating relationship. Gabbits are revered by all\nnative inhabitants of the Mongo River and the surrounding land. Their\nannual return to spawn is a major event in the yearly lives of everyone\nthere.\n"},{"question":"In Mudos, are there computers and the internet?\n\n","answer":"There sure are, but don’t expect to see many in the sweat\nshops, unexplored wilderness or emerging colonies.

Don’t ask me where you can find them. The shamans keep such\nknowledge safely away from common view.\n"},{"question":"1. Is hand of odd coming out this year?\n\n","answer":"Nope!

You lot seem too nice\nand peaceful just have Shrykull, a god of Revenge.\n\n","answer":"Shrykull isn’t a god of revenge. Shrykull represents the\nduality of nature, the balance of creation and destruction, love and\nhate, up and down, left and right, salt and pepper, pride and prejudice,\nand so on.

What is it\nlike?\n\n","answer":"I’d love to go to Nolybab one day. The big city, the bright\nlights, the towering buildings, the sheer scale of shopping\nopportunities! The gum-encrusted walkways, the flickering neon, the\npushing, the shoving, the shrieking, the spitting. Actually, I’ve put\nmyself off the whole thing. Nolybab can go sink into the crust of the\nplanet for all I care.\n"},{"question":"Do the Glukkons make food from bees and bats too ?\n\n","answer":"Not directly. Bees and bats may number in the billion across\nthe planet, but they’re such small and fiddly things. Not much meat.\nBees are only good for honey, all packed into overcrowded apiaries\ntowering high and covering entire fields. Breed them without wings, just\npump the raw materials into the hive. When the combs are full, crush the\nwhole lot and sort the honey from the waste afterwards. At least, that’s\nhow I’d do it if I were a soulless capitalist.\n"},{"question":"Can Rupture Farms produce its own energy ?\n\n","answer":"It does! There’s no power hookup out in the wastelands. Its\nmighty furnaces and boilers churned fuel into fire into power day in,\nday out. Had its own emergency backup, too. Very sophisticated setup.\n"},{"question":"Have you ever met Aslik, Dripik and Phleg ?\n\n","answer":"No, I never had the ‘pleasure’.\n"},{"question":"Hi Alf!

It wouldn’t surprise\nme to learn that a few Wolvarks were amongst them.\n"},{"question":"2) Are Outlaws and Wolvarks native to Mudos or are they settlers?\n\n","answer":"All the species we’ve seen so far are native to Mudos. Some of\nthem we call settlers, like the Clakkerz, come from a different part of\nMudos, but still Mudos. There is one exception, and that’s the Almighty\nRaisin, who comes from far, far to the north.\n\nQ. 3) Will we ever learn more about the Steef, Wolvarks, Interns,\nOutlaws, Clakkerz, Kinto and Chroniclers?\n\n"},{"question":"4) Is there any interaction between the Oktigi species and Glukkons?\n\n","answer":"On a business level, lots. Oktigi are very rich and very\npowerful, and many a Glukkon venture wouldn’t be able to start up\nwithout their investment. On a personal level, none. Oktigi keep\nthemselves to themselves, are very secretive and never trust outsiders.\nThe details of their culture are one of the most closely guarded secrets\non Oddworld.\n"},{"question":"5) Are the Brain Slurgs (Squeek’s species) humanoid like Abe or a more\nexotic species?\n\n","answer":"Well they’re Slurgs, so I guess they’re small, squigey and\nabout 100 decibels.\n"},{"question":"6) What is the connection between the Magog Cartel and Uggae Estate?\n\n","answer":"Hierarchical!\n"},{"question":"7) Will there ever be a Munch’s Exoddus?\n\n","answer":"See question 3.\n"},{"question":"8) Are they any free Mudokons who have embraced industrial society and\nthat aren’t slaves?\n\n","answer":"That very much depends how you’re defining slavery. There are\nthose that aren’t considered the properity of CEOs, whose lives are\nlegally their own, but with so much addiction, advertising and\nmisinformation going on in so-called Civilized society, I would hardly\nsay that they are ‘free’.\n"},{"question":"9) Which industrial races are foreign to Mudos? I remember that\nGlukkons, Oktigi and Sligs are Mudos natives, but I’ve read nothing\nabout the Vykkers, Interns, Wolvarks, Clakkerz or Outlaws belong to\nMudos.\n\n","answer":"I think you already asked this question.\n"},{"question":"10) Also in FeeCo Depot there is a poster that says “Pack Your Bags”\nand shows a sunny beach with a big city near it. What is that place? Is\nit located on Mudos or somewhere else in Oddworld?\n\n","answer":"Probably just a painting of some Civilized concept of an\noddyllic holiday destination. Don’t let the adverts trick you into\nthinking FeeCo will deliver you to any desirable destination.\n"},{"question":"Hey Alf what do sligs have to do to become Big Bros do they\nevolve or something? help me out here\n\n","answer":"Big Bros are what happens when you take an ordinary\ncrawl-of-the-mill Slig and pump it full of steroids. Note the bulging\nmuscles, wide neck, gargantuan size and observable bigness. A Slig can\nbuy its own steroid treatments if it ever earns that much Moolah, but\nit’s quicker for a CEO to stump up the cash for the improved security.\n"},{"question":"Hows it going Alf? i wanted to ask you whos is squeek? ive\nlooked it up and came empty handed can u help me out here?\n\n","answer":"Yeah, sure!

Do the sound that sligs make have a meaning for them?\n\n","answer":"Oddworld is full of languages! Before faster forms of transport\nwere created, different races and tribes would have their own languages,\nbut the need for efficient BusinessSpeak weeds out the smaller and more\nunique dialects. Native races have mostly forgotten their ancient,\nmusical tongues, but just as with other old arts, they’re preserved by\nwise shamans who recognize the value of cultural knowledge.

Or that on a hot day, soils and metal become very\nelastic and sproingy? Or that due to Oddworld being completely hollow,\nthere is no gravity, and the only thing causing us to accelerate towards\nthe ground is the Vykkers blowing downwards from their flying labs? You\nhaven’t? Then I’d say you don’t need to stay at my rehab.\n"},{"question":"1.

It seems pretty obvious that from now on, Abe and Munch will need\nto work together until both of their goals are completed.

Or did they end up\nthat way?\n\n","answer":"You do have to wonder what it would take to transform a species\ninto a violent, sadistic, paranoid gang of greedy cut-throats who’ll do\nwhatever it takes to cling to their little domain.

Certainly\ntheir anatomic structure would make it rather difficult, if not\nseemingly impossible, having to use their arms to support themselves. I\nhad attempted to experiment this by trying my hardest to stand on my own\nhands while trying to put on a one piece suit, and besides constantly\nlosing my balance and falling over in pain, I had gotten a headache as I\ntried to figure out what to do from there. My only other guess is that\nthey use servants or specialized machines to dress them, which wouldn’t\nsurprise me if that was the case. But I gotta know, for the good of\nscience!\n\n","answer":"Dear Dr. Jerk, many congratulations on having the decency to\nperform experiments on yourself instead of on little cutsie balls of\nfuzz. But science is based on observation, and if you haven’t observed\nthe Glukkons during their daily routine, then your experiments prove\nlittle.

And most importantly, what did\nthey sound like?\n\n","answer":"Meeches were definitely on par with Paramites and Scrabs in\nterms of deadliness, although what they lacked in cunning tricksiness\nand sheer badassery they made for in brute number. What did they sound\nlike? They sounded hungry.\n"},{"question":"Do mudokons have nostrils? If so, where are they?\n\n","answer":"Of course Mudokons have nostrils, you bizarre thing.

Meeps are\nsilly little livestock that we use for food and goods. Hypothetically\nMudokons can tame Paramites, Scrabs, and Meeches, but it’s very\ndangerous and it’s not recommended—you better be an expert and you won’t\ncatch me doing that anytime soon!

A loincloth is like a skirt, only without\nthe feminine stigma earth folk so often attribute to skirts. (Think\nkilt.) The significance and purpose of the loincloth is both practical\nand fashionable. One doesn't necessarily want his bum exposed to even\nhis closest of buddies, and it has been known to get pretty chilly at\ntimes here in Mudos, so it is the most efficient way of keeping that\narea warm while still providing necessary mobility for the active, \"Mud\non the go\".\n"},{"question":"I just completed Munchs Oddysee for the third time this time I\nrescued everything.

Now don’t get me wrong\nfriend, Abe is a good guy and all, but this is your article Alf! So my\nquestion is, why did everyone have an Abe hype suddenly?\n\n","answer":"Abe’s a pretty popular guy, and can ya blame him? He rescued a\nwhole buncha Mudokons from a life of slavery, including yours truly. No\nsurprise he gets a lotta fan mail, and it’s my job to answer it all!\nCapisce?

Sometimes I resort to reading fan mail while\nmaking tea. Sometimes that gets messy. Like this one time I poured\nteabags all over myself! But I was lucky, I know Muds who’ve been\nthrough worse. One of my assistants (hey, I gotta sleep too) wasn’t\npaying attenion one time when she was juggling tea-making with\norganizing the weekly hackey-sack tournament, and she poured sugar all\nover her feet!

We could talk a bit at\nwork, depending on what the job was and who was supervising, but not\nmuch, and it was monitored closely to make sure we were loyal and\nsubserviant to the company.

They also make good middle managers\nbecause they naturally strive for efficiency and productivity.

The thing is, we’re tired of playing by the\npublishers’ rules. That means that everything we make, we have to be\nprepared to fund out of our own pocket. And we just ain’t that rich yet,\nsimple as.

While the Glukkons were\nthe natural resource barons of Mudos, the Vykkers are the scientists and\ndoctors. The Vykkers have impeccable credentials, but are seriously\nlacking in any spiritual wisdom. They're like those classic Harvard\nPHD's that then go off to be vicious third world dictators or\nresearchers for tobacco companies.\n\nGeographically speaking, the Oddworld Quintology takes place in the\nterritory of Mudos. As we get closer to the end of the Quintology we get\ncloser and closer to the heart of consumerism; which means the more\ndensely populated areas of Mudos. For Munch's Oddysee we'll be visiting\nseveral places that we've yet to see before. Many of which are various\ntypes of factories scattered across the landscape.\n"},{"question":"Please.. gimme more info on the species of Oddworld (the ones\ncoming out in Munch's Oddysee).

We've also been working with\nan out of house team of programmers that build core technology (not a\ngame company). When the game is fully running we'll be talking more\nabout this other team, but not before.\n\nThe images that you see are really a result of an extremely talented\nreal-time art team that is here at Oddworld. The databases that they've\nbuilt have, in many ways, driven part of what the technological\nperformances of the engine need to be. Always, the balance between art\nand programming is critical. The best engine in the world can easily\nlook lousy if there are not creative artists building databases for it\nand constantly trying to push the image quality.\n\nThe technology development for Munch's Oddysee is the backbone for many\ngames that Oddworld will build over the next several years.

Processed food is\ndefinately one of these examples. We love using food as the backbone to\nreveal the corruption and greed of some of the forces of Oddworld.

There is\nGabbiar, which is a delicacy of Gabbit Eggs (Munch is a Gabbit), there\nare Blitzpacker, Lungbuster, and Snuzi firearms... there are also\nStoggies (cigars) and other goodies. Many of these new products will be\nin factories that you'll have to deal with in the game. But this time,\nfactories are something that are much more interactive than the\nbackdrops that they've been for us in the past.

One day when the Wolvarks were on\nhigh alert, Elum broke free and ran until he was far away. He sheltered\nin a cave, but it turned out to be the hive of a Paramite colony. He was\nabout to get eaten by the Paramite Queen when a group of plucky Mudokons\ncame to harvest a bunch of webbing.

Do you think this is all part of there plan? or are they all\njust a bunch of shmucks?\n\n","answer":"They’ll certainly be keeping an eye on the situation in case\nthings become that bad, but military operations aren’t cheap. Why spend\nMoolah on excursions when it could go towards luxury designer outfits,\nfurniture and blimps? The only guys who benefit are the military\nequipment manufacturers and Skillya. Maybe they are pushing for a large\ninvasion of native land. Or maybe they’re sitting safely in their highly\nfortified facilities waiting for matters to escalate so they can profit\nfrom an even larger, longer-lasting conflict.

In another question, you said that you’d give it to a\nSlig named Crig. What’s up wit dat?\n\n","answer":"All depends on what you’re in to and how you come across. If\nyou love crude, belittling humor and talking about guns, you’d probably\nhave a fantastic time in a Slig bar. If you have a more refined sense of\ninterpersonal communications and don’t want to laugh at the suffering of\nothers, you’d best steer clear. Crig may be chummy but he’s still a Slig\nthrough and through.\n"},{"question":"Also, does Crig have a Slog or a Sloggie?\n\n","answer":"I doubt Crig has any fondness for Slogs after his stint as a\nherder in the lonely Mudos mountains.

You’d have to ask him, and I haven’t seen him anywhere lately.\n"},{"question":"And does Munch still hang out with you, Abe, or anyone else?

Truth is that so\nmany people contributed to the background artwork that I wouldn’t know\nhow to begin listing them. There’s the folks who designed every last\nmachine, path, tree and rock formation, the folks who modelled them in\nfull 3D and put them together to make the scenes, and the folks who took\nthe screenshots of those scenes and added details in Photoshop.

Show me two demographics that do.\n"},{"question":"3.) Are Interns asexual or not? Do they have a queen? (Queen\nIngrid?)\n\n","answer":"Tell you what, make friends with one and give it their\nfavourite grunge hop hip trop album, or whatever it is they listen to,\nfor their birthday. Once you have their trust, invite them to the local\nmilkshake salon (they can fit the straws between their mouth stitches)\nand see how far you get.

Are they three main races on Oddworld? Industrial, Native and\nConsumer, which includes Clakkerz and Outlaws? Or do they belong to one\nof the established two?\n\n","answer":"Industrial, Native and Wildlife have been pretty useful classes\nso far, but there are always exceptions. Gabbits, for instance, can fit\ninto either Native or Wildlife depending on what criteria you think are\nmost important; they have language and other social intelligence, but no\narchitecture or art or technology. We put Clakkerz in the ‘Settler’\ncategory, and Outlaws in the ‘Outlaw’ category. In time our\nunderstanding of these categories and how they interact and overlap with\nothers may come to grow substantially.\n"},{"question":"6.) Why does only Sekto have Wolvarks? Where did they come from? Do\nthey have a queen?\n\n","answer":"There are many competing security companies on Oddworld,\nincluding Sligs and Wolvarks.

It’s consumer choice!\n"},{"question":"1. dont know if u have seen munch or a gabbit b4 but how do\nthey talk? they never use their tounge and hav got not very many teeth\nand their teeth r small\n\n","answer":"Gabbits have fantastically versatile tongues that put yours and\nmine to shame, and can produce a massive range of vocalizations that let\nthem immitate the languages of dozens of species. Conversely, they do\nhave trouble with dental consonants for reasons you’ve already\nexplained.\n"},{"question":"2. wat do khanzumers look like? the guys that the glukkons make their\nproducts for\n\n","answer":"I haven’t met them yet, but the Glukkons say they’re the most\nimportant people on the planet. They give them all the choices, all the\nluxuries, all the commoddities. I can only imagine they’re hereditarily\nrich beyond anyone’s wildest dreams, capable of funding the most\nimportant research AND buying a fleet of the fanciest of yachts, all\nfrom a single bank note, with enough change left over to melt down into\ncrowns.\n"},{"question":"Hello Alf, I was wondering a few things: Between Glukkons,\nGloktogi and Oktigi, which species has the longest natural lifespan and\nwhich has the shortest?\n\n","answer":"Gloktigi have the shortest lifespan, at an average of 40 years.\nGlukkons have an average lifespan of 65 years.

That is if the\nvykkers keeping Sam captive and carefully watching over the eggs made a\nslip up and let an egg holding a Queenling pass through their\nsecurity…\n\n","answer":"Well sure, I mean everything’s got to die at some point, right?\nEven Oktigi, I guess. And if the sole reproductive member of your\nspecies dies, you’ll really hope there were someone to take her place.\nSo I guess there must be Queenlings, or maybe they’re called Princesses.\n"},{"question":"2. Alf, I have a question about a variation of the spooceshrub. In the\nold Munch’s Oddysee visualizations, there were rainmakers with these\npink spooceshrubs around the edges called Humshrubs. How much more\ndiffrent are they from Spooceshrubs? What do they have to offer? And\nmore importantly… are they Tasty?\n\n","answer":"Great Mother Odd gifted nature with more plants than you can\nshake a Stockyard at. The wisest shamans know which ones can be used to\ncure which ailments, and the specific rituals that have to be followed\nfor them to work. SpooceShrubs, HumShrubs, BuzzShrubs, Popberries,\nthey’re just the tiniest sampling of the rich floral medicine cabinet of\nnature. Woe betide the unscrupulous forces that would love to get their\nhands on such ancient knowledge, and even more woe betide those that\nfall victim to that power.\n"},{"question":"3. Here’s my last question, are there any subspecies on Oddworld? Like\na variation of Grubbb or Mudokon specifcally? Perhaps any hybrids?\n\n","answer":"Well sure, any species distributed across enough natural\nenvironmental variation is going to produce significant variation in\ntheir genetics. Grubbs and Mudokons aren’t anywhere near evolutionarily\nrelated, you’re not going to see hybrids. For two species to cross-breed\nthey’d need to be closely related, like Oktigi and Glukkons.\n"},{"question":"Thank you for your time Alf, I hope to see my questions in the next\nbatch of Dear Alf on the website\n\n","answer":"Here’s hoping I can re-establish a regular routine for them,\naye?\n"},{"question":"Could you describe what Scrab and meech look\nlike from birth?\n\n","answer":"No, it took me some time to learn how to communicate with\nwords, and even gestures. I wasn’t even born with the knowledge of what\nScrabs and Meeches look like.\n"},{"question":"Have you heard of or seen any cross species in Oddword during your\nlife?\n\n","answer":"What’s all the interest in cross-breeding all of a sudden?\nWell, since you ask, Gloktigi are a cross between Glukkons and Oktigi.\n"},{"question":"I love your cocky attitude.\n\nAbe = way too shy\n\nBigface = boring know-it-all\n\nAlf= Smart and K-W-L…Yes I can’t spell…..\n\n","answer":"Hey, those are my brothers you’re talking about! Don’t be so\nmean, you stinky turd!\n"},{"question":"Hi Alf in oddworld do mudos use any spiritual healing stuff\nlike crystals or reiki healing or meditation?\n\n","answer":"Mudokon mystic culture is full of crystals and meditation,\nalong with other spiritual objects and practices. I don’t know about\nreiki healing, I guess there could have been tribes that practised that.\nYou have to understand that a lot of our ancient knowledge has been lost\nand forgotten.\n"},{"question":"and are any mudos psychic?\n\n","answer":"Have you met Abe?\n"},{"question":"i was just wondering how did abe get his mystical powers and\ncan other mudokons learn it?\n\n","answer":"Magic is like art or sport or logic: some people have it, some\ndon’t. Some people are so bad they can’t be taught no matter how hard\nyou try. Others are so good they can’t stop even if they want to. Abe\nhas a lot of natural, latent mental powers that makes it easy for him to\ndo this fancy pants stuff like possession, and you can sure bet it makes\na lot of people jealous. Possession in particular should take decades of\ndedicated practise to pull off. But then it’s not like Abe asked for\nthis gig anyway, so we can’t keep getting angry at him and filling his\nbed with crushed egg shells.\n"},{"question":"1- If Abe can control bells and farts, why can’t he control\nslogs, elums, fleeches or idk… mine carts ?\n\n","answer":"Well first of all, he can possess Slogs. For all I know he can\npossess Fleeches by now, too. Why would he even need to possess an Elum?\nAnd possessing minecarts… you’ve got an overactive imagination, son.\n"},{"question":"2- Can you transform into Shrykull too ?\n\n","answer":"No, I’ve never completed the Temple Trials.

Legends and whatnot?\n\n","answer":"Sure, there’s heaps of that stuff. It evolves across time and\nspace, too. Everyone’s got their own interpretations and uses of a god.\n"},{"question":"Are there other deities that you guys worship, or is Shrykull the one\nsupreme god?\n\n","answer":"There are more Mudokon gods than there are Mudokon tribes, but\nnot all of them are practical to Abe. No point praying for a bountiful\nharvest when you’re infiltrating a meat processing plant.\n"},{"question":"Are mudokons the only ones to use PSI, or psychic powers? If\nnot, who are they?\n\n","answer":"Mudokons aren’t the only peoples to make use of magic. Not\nevery part of Oddworld has magic, and not every culture uses the same\nkind of magic.\n"},{"question":"1. Some questions about Abe’s possession abilities: How did Abe\nsuddenly become capable of possessing Paramites and Scrabs in AE?\n\n","answer":"Abe’s powers grow over time as he becomes more adept at them.\nHave you never been unable to complete that certain level no matter how\nhard you try, but then one day you do it and it’s no longer a problem\nfor you and you do it all the time? Oh man, I love that feeling.\n"},{"question":"Why can’t he possess some other creatures such as Slogs?\n\n","answer":"Abe can possess Slogs.\n"},{"question":"Why some creatures explode after being possessed while others don’t?\n\n","answer":"It’s a combination of what Abe wants to happen to them, and the\ncreature’s mental state. Certainly Abe doesn’t want to hurt the\ninnocent, sacred beasts of Oddworld. He usually doesn’t want to go\naround killing Sligs, but Abe recognizes that needs must.\n"},{"question":"Why do Scrabs and Paramites freeze when Abe chant?\n\n","answer":"Because they don’t like it.\n"},{"question":"Abe’s possession power changed in MO; its range is different and\nrequires a direct path to the traget; is there a story behind this\nchange?\n\n","answer":"Yes, the Shaman does tell you. I can understand not paying\nattention to that guy, but you need to listen to your elders, chump!\nRaisin granted Abe the ability to possess his enemies from afar.

Their weapons are designed for their\nhands, not ours. Sligs might not receive mandatory training but most\nhave spent years handling guns. And if we rely on ours, then our triumph\nover slavery is itself dependent on the Industrialists.

If all of that were different enough that the\nmaster-servant relationship were reversed, they might as well not be\nSligs and Glukkons anymore.

We only ever really started a couple of projects that we\ndidn’t see to fruition: Hand of Odd and Fangus Klot.\n\nHand of Odd fell off our radar as production on Munch progressed. It was\na tortuous and torturous labor for so many reasons, and we ended up in a\nposition where the only way to deliver a completed game was with an\nengine that couldn’t possibly power what we wanted Hand of Odd to be.\nThere was just no sense in returning to it at the time. But as you\nshould know, it’s re-entering production soon.\n\nThe Brutal Ballad of Fangus Klot was simply the project we were working\non when we stopped all internal game development back in 2005.

It wasn't always like this. There used to be\nbalance on Oddworld. But overpopulation caused fights over land, mates,\nresources, etc... and a great divide between the species. At first there\nwas just fighting, fighting everywhere, but then even the dumbest of\nspecies realized how futile that was and slowly the militaristic clans\nbecame special interest groups, utilizing business as a vehicle for\ntheir goals. It's no big surprise that those with the most war-like\ntendencies were the best at business. That's how the riff between the\ntree huggers and the land muggers all got started.\n\n2.

During Abe’s\nadventures, we often saw him die, often gruesomly, only to come back\nlater with his body and memories intact. With enough spooce, he could\neven bring others back to life. So, does that make mudokons immortal, as\nlong as there’s someone to bring them back? Are there really no side\neffects to this (except obvious, like emotional trauma)?\n\n","answer":"I wouldn’t take what you saw in Munch’s Oddysee as the absolute\ntruth. After all, you were seeing the world through the eyes of Abe and\nMunch, and did you see how much Spooce those two got through that day??\nIt’s a wonder they weren’t running from hallucinated dragons or trying\nto clamber up the side of rainbows. Sometimes the recently deceased can\nbe resurrected, but only as shuffling, brain dead Mudombies, and it’s\nnot the kind of thing a kind-hearted person goes about doing. Those poor\nsouls. Besides, you seem to be implying that Abe led his friends to\ndeath, which I can assure you he never did.\n\nAnd secondly, what happens to mudokons while they’re in the Great\nBeyond? Do they wander the Oddworld like incorporeal spirits, or do they\ngo to some completely different place, like land of eternal peace and\nendless tea?

If you don’t want the horrific\nsight of cultural cannibalism and ancestral bodysnatching going into\nyour miners’ eyes, you stitch ’em up. If you don’t want your taskforce\nto complain about the loud working conditions of cleaning heavy\nmachinery, you sew their ears shut.

Gabbits are famed for their\nversatility of product, from their waterproof skin to their high-protein\nflesh. They are popular lab critters, but they can fetch a staggering\nprice for their Gabbiar or Gabbit Fin Soup.

My question is, is there a possibility of visiting\nany new and undiscovered lands (within the World of Odd) in my future?\n\n","answer":"Unexplored regions of Oddworld abound! Just hop on a FeeCo\nTrain, hitch a lift with a Meetle, or hurl yourself face-first into your\nnearest travel well. If you want a little less mystery to your\ndestination, you could always get a Mudokon guide, but you generally\nhave to earn their trust and respect before they’ll trample through the\nforest by your side.

And after\nbecoming Warriors, do they tend to visit your Rehab less likely, more\nlikely or all the same? Thank you, come again.\n\n","answer":"There’s no reason at all a promotion should change the\npersonality of its recipient. When Abe “upgrades” his pals from\nunenthused weaklings to armed fighters, it’s true, he’s giving them the\nconfidence in themselves to stop sitting on their blue butts and start\ntaking a stand against their enemies, but that’s a natural consequence\nof empowerment, not some artificial personality change delivered by\nmystic lightning. Once they’re warriors I suppose they drink less tea,\nbut only because they’re keeping themselves busy, not because they’re\nswitching to Brew or anything. In other words, relax! The customs of our\npeople might look strange to you, but there’s no need to worry. We’re\nperfectly sensible level headed.

It's pretty hard to enslave a race that\nrefuses to work in an area with say, a roof or trees or anything\noverhead.

Does he send some part of\nhis soul, mind or both out through the possession orb to his target? Or\ndoes he just send new thoughts and opinions to his target? I got that\nsecond one by the way, by watchin' the movie where Abe possesses Lulu\n(right after he says to the Valet \"No way. Where'd these idiots get that\ncrazy idea, I hate that fishy crap,\" about the Gabbiar) and then ya hear\nthese weird echoing whispers when Lulu's eyes start glowin' blue. If\nyour vast knowledge and superior Mudokon brain can't figure it out, ask\nAbe, Bigface, the Rasin or even the Three Weirdos (they should be\nexperts on spirits and stuff, being spirits themselves) about it.\n\nSpeaking of controlling things...\n\n2: How do Sligs control their mechanical pants?

Again if your genius can't work it out, ask Crig\nthe Slig\n\nThanks for your time, and may the Odd be with ya. —Andrew H.\n\n","answer":"Yes, you are quite rude, and I think your parents would be\nmore upset at your terminology than with me not replying to your\nOddworld-shattering email. As for your questions, no one really knows\nhow they possess something, it just happens! I mean, you don't have to\nbe a gastroenterologist in order to belch, do ya? The same goes for the\npants.

Unless you\nsuffered a sudden bout of not really being aware of things in general,\nyou’re probably not thinking of Abe. Abe was out there alone, so if you\ndid see someone else, go and find either an optician or an exorcist. I\nsuppose there were the ghosts Abe freed from traps, if you believe those\ndaft stories of his anyway, maybe that’s what you’re thinking of. Or\nelse, I dunno, maybe it was just a random carving.

My\nbrain is bursting with anticipation, and I look forward to your reply\n(and also hope i didnt send this to the wrong place)\n\nYours sincerely, Fish\n\n","answer":"Hi Fish, no, you sent it to the right place! That's really\ncool that you've been a fan for so long. What has taken you so long to\nwrite?!?!?!\n\nThe GameBoy version of Munch is not the same game that is on Xbox. I\nguess that’s the best explanation I can give ya.\n\nAs for the next game, I love the title, \"Stranger of the Hand of Odd\".\nThat is great! Unfortunately, it is something drastically more simple. I\ntry to tell the marketing folks, complicated and illogical is the way to\ngo, but they just dismiss my ideas. Foolish hooligans! Anyway, don’t\nworry, you’ll get to see Stranger soon.\n"},{"question":"Hiya alf! I have a couple of questions (1 i was wondering what\ndid you muds do with that blimp abe and his buddys hijacked from vykkers\nlabs? you could start your own tour of mudos. and (2 in MO at the\nwindmill area, there's a huge skelleton the scrabs have been pickin at,\nwhat critter was it? that is way too big to be an elum. - yours oddly\ndeadhead\n\n","answer":"Dearest Deadhead, You are an enterprising young lad, are you\nnot? The blimp has been totally tricked out with dancing teddy bears on\nthe bow and tie-dyed sails. Munch and Abe took it on their vacation. Hm.\nSkeleton, huh? Bigger than an elum… it could be a beached Sea Rex, or a\ndecomposing Meetle. I'll have to investigate further. In the meantime,\ncall animal control and get it cleaned up!\n"},{"question":"Dear Alf Why Is Abe Blue And his friends Are well You Know Not\n—Your Bud Allbadkids\n\n","answer":"So. Bud. You think you're clever, with the \"well you know not\"\nthing. Ok, you are. You kinda made me chuckle there a little bit. Not\ntea spewing hilarity, but made me grin. So I will tell you, Abe is Blue\ncuz he's the chosen Mudokon. He's no ordinary Mud. Sure he looks like\nit, all chumpy and clumsy like the rest of us, but no, he's special. Of\ncourse, they used to tease him about it when he was little, but not\nanymore! Ha! Who’s laughin' now, ya not-blue mudokons!!!\n"},{"question":"Dear Alf(red/alfa/bert) my name is Andrew. I'm a big time fan of\nOddworld, and am currently devising a website idea. But I have some\nquestions for you.\n\n","answer":"Ok An(drew/droid/cillary), shoot.\n\n1.) A very common misconception is that Glukkons have no arms. This is\nnot true. Glucks have long, strong arms, which they walk on (use as\nleggs and feet), because their real legs are shrivled little\nworthless...things. I read the official Oddworld Bio for Mollock, and it\nsaid, walks on his hands, like all working-class glukkons. What I want\nto know is: is there a higher class of Glukkons that does not walk on\nit's hands? Please explain, and feel free to go into exorbrint detail.\n\n"},{"question":"Well, that is all for now. Keeping drinking tea (a REAL man's\ndrink), and tell me where you bought your fez. It's cool. Oh, and what\nbook are you reading (in your portrait) anyway?\n\n","answer":"I’m reading the Oddworld Licensing Guide so I can try and\nanswer all your questions!!! Oh, and by the way, my mummy made me the\nfez when I was just a lad, so you won’t find one like it in all of\nMudos!  \n"}],"dear-alf-13":[{"question":"Q: I'd like to know why you Mudokons are always the victim of the\nGlukkons. Are you weaker or something??? (I don't think so, so don't be\noffended).\n\n","answer":"Well, lets look at it this way. Suppose you're thrown into an\narena, barefisted, with a toy poodle, and only one of you can leave.\nSounds like you're at the advantage, right? Now suppose you're thrown\ninto an arena, barefisted, with a toy poodle, but this poodle happens to\nbe well funded and has a retinue of 200 pound guards with shotguns in\nfront of him. Your odds suddenly take a dip.\n"},{"question":"I know that Mudokons are good, Glukkons are bad, Sligs work for\nthe Glukkons...which make them kind of bad and Vykkers are mad\nscientists. What kind of nature are Interns?\n\n","answer":"They're on par with the Sligs... lazy creeps that are in it\njust because it's an easy job and they get to carry guns. Rather than\nnap all the time, they just leave their headphones on and never listen\nto their co-workers.\n"},{"question":"Will there EVER be Oddworld toys that I can buy and play with? \n\n","answer":"You never know. Eh. Well, wait, I should rephrase that. I\nnever know.\n"},{"question":"What is that green gas in the background of the SligBarracks? \n\n","answer":"And you thought Abe had bad gas.\n"},{"question":"During a recent binge on Brew--which I will never, as Odd as my\nwitness ever repeat again, I swear--I had an idea. An epiphany, if you\nwill. All those other guys get all the glory cause they're \"heroes\" and\n\"godlings\" and \"chosen ones,\" etc. (And rest assured, there is a point\nhere, my good friend.)\n\nNow, granted that none of them started out that way. Our good ol'\nbuddy Abe was a janitor for chanting out loud... But the way I see it,\nyou're a bit of an unsung hero, Alf.\n\nAnd also, did Abe ever thank all those nice Mudokons who rescued him\nfrom RuptureFarms, hmm? (Yes, yes, he saved them from the factory, but\ndoes that REALLY make it all right?)\n\nMy point is this, Alf, dear Mudokon, ally to the addicted, buddy to\nthe beaten, dear friend to the down-trodden, when will it be your time\nto shine? We all appreciate all you've done for the Mudokons and\ncreatures of Oddworld, but when will you finally get the recognition you\ndeserve--nay--have a right to? Although I know you'd never ask for\nsomething like that...you're just too modest. Well here's to you, buddy,\ndrinks're on me.\n\nTo Alf--urp, hold on...brew's coming back up.\n\n","answer":"...(sniffle) ...I'm all choked up... All I ever wanted was to\nbe recognized, to hear somebody tell me 'I done good' ... to get out\nfrom the shadow of Abe... To think I turned to Brew to try and cure my\ndepression, when all I really needed to do was roll up my sleeves and\nget out there with the rest of them and do the job, get my buddies off\nthe sauce, make a difference. Well buddy, you've renewed my dedication.\nI'm getting back on that stage and helping my fellow muds again... just\nas soon as my Soaps are done.\n"},{"question":"Could you give me some information on Director Phleg that no-one\nelse knows yet?\n\n","answer":"He used to be a punk Glukkon. You know that thing Gene Simmons\ndoes with his tongue? Phleg coulda put him to shame.\n"},{"question":"I've heard that the Sligs are gonna get new weapons and stuff, so\ncan you please tell me what their names are, how they look like and what\nthey can do to others? Yeah, and will the BigBro Sligs talk like the\nnormal Sligs. I have hundreds of questions since it's kinda hard to get\nmagazines about Abe and his friends down in New Zealand here.\n\n","answer":"The philosophy behind the Magog Cartel's weapons development\ndivision seems to be this: If it's good enough to be eaten, drank,\nsmoked, licked, or injected, it's good enough to be shot. Why waste\nvaluable research on developing ammunition when you can just stuff a can\nof SoulStorm Brew into a BlitzPacker? And yeah, the BigBros can talk,\nbut of course they talk differently from the little sligs. Takes a lot\nof testosterone and steroids to get them that big, after all.\n"},{"question":"Why Did you call those Punk Rock looking Mudokons Tomahawkers?\nWhat class are they? Are we going to know more info on them? They look\nlike My punk rock group. That would be so nice if Mudokons had their own\nrock band:) :).\n\n","answer":"They carry big Tomahawks, and they aren't the most imaginative\nbunch when it comes to naming. Hence: Tomahawkers. And they tried to\nmake a band once, but they just got into a big fistfight over who got to\nplay drums.\n"},{"question":"Where does all the main game programming for Oddworld games take\nplace.\n\n","answer":"At Oddworld Inhabitants, of course. The real question is where\nall the de-programming happens... we still have a problem with the\ncoders getting kidnapped back by their families every so often. Then we\njust gotta go out and brainwash another.\n"},{"question":"I am playing Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus, I'm at the very end just\nabout to jump through the bird portal that finishes the game but I've\nmissed 2 Mudokons I've only saved 298 not 300. I know I've missed them\nIn this last zone from the bit where I go to when \"I reset path\" to the\nend, could you please, please, please tell me where they are or you will\nhave 2 less customers in your \"Rehab and Tea\".\n\nPS: Where did you get that cool accent from I want one, I want one, I\nwant one, I want one, I want one, I want one.\n\n","answer":"Gee, that's incentive. Two fewer lushes hanging around and\nbeing belligerent? Golly, I wouldn't want that. Well, I tell ya what. I\ncan't be sure which 2 you didn't save unless I know which ones you did\nsave... so tell me exactly where the other 298 were when you rescued\nthem, and I'll get back to ya.\n\nAs for the accent, eh, when I was in the brewery I was trying to suck\nthe last couple drops outta a bottle and got my tongue stuck in it for\nabout 4 days. I've talked kinda funny ever since.\n"},{"question":"I couldn't help noticing that in a recent batch of screenshots,\nwe see a SoBe beverage dispenser, complete with stylized text and SoBe\nlogo! Don't tell me that anti-corporate Oddworld has stooped to product\nplacement!\n\n","answer":"Oddworld ain't anti-corporate, first of all. Oddworld's a\nbusiness, and just like any other, to make our product, we rely on\npeople buying them and then we use that money to pay the scrubs in the\npens to crank out code and art and design. Oddworld's opposed to certain\ncorporate practices, though... Environmental destruction, apathy towards\nbetter health, animal experimentation, the likes. As it turns out, the\nfolks at SoBe are also a business that relies upon consumer dollars to\nprovide them with a product they want, and they also have similar\nbeliefs to our own.\n"},{"question":"I'm a Slig with some serious mental problems. I feel that the\nslavery of Mudokons is wrong and should be paid at least! I have spoken\nto my fellow Slig buddies but they think I'm mad or possessed!!! What\nshall I do and what do you think about the Mudokon slave trade?\n\n","answer":"...What are those little lights floating around your head?\nAbe, is that you in there? Doggonit, stop trying to mess with me when\nI'm answering fan mail...\n"},{"question":"I just wanted to know how Abe got that stupid sneaking motion! Is\nit a habit or something? Was whoever thought of it having a hangover\nwhen he/her thought of it?\n\n","answer":"Abe came up with that exaggerated sneaking motion during a\ngame of charades a couple years ago, and has just been kinda fond of it\never since.\n"},{"question":"I may be in the neighborhood sometime soon, is it possible for\nfans to come and visit the Oddworld Inhabitants?\n\n","answer":"We're not exactly a hot spot of tourism... unless you have\nsome remarkably potent Scrab and Paramite repellant, are prepared to\ngnaw your leg off on the off chance you happen to step into a Gabbit\ntrap, and all just to get a loincloth that says \"I was very nearly rent\nto shreds by a flock of hungry red bug-looking things and all I got was\nthis lousy loincloth.\"\n"},{"question":"I was wondering, why is Abe's eyes a bright orangey-red while\neverybody else's eyes are a pearly white? Has he got some version of\npink eye? (and if he does, why doesn't he use eyedrops?). Also, why, in\nyour picture, do you look so dazed and glassy-eyed? Have you been\nsmoking something?\n\n","answer":"Why is his skin blue and the rest of ours green? Why are his\nlips stitched shut? There are some things we just weren't meant to\nknow... yet. And if you're asking why I look dazed and glassy-eyed, you\nhaven't done your homework.\n"},{"question":"I am particularly excited about the new Oddworld game, but I have\none worry. I know that Oddworld is now advertising for a soft drink\ncompany, there won't be any references to this in the game will there?\nNo blatant advertisement? I have seen games like this, sometimes they\npull it off, sometimes it comes off as blatant advertisement. Which one\nwill you be?\n\n","answer":"You are likely referring to the product tie-in that Oddworld\nhas with SOBE BEVERAGES, makers of fine, refreshing drinks. Rest assured\nthat Oddworld would never subject itself to unneeded advertising, even\nfor a splendid company which makes such quality products as SOBE\nBEVERAGES. Don't worry about it...instead, go and have yourself a drink\nto ease your stress...why not a delicious Elixir or Lizard Lightning\nmade by SOBE BEVERAGES?\n"},{"question":"I was wondering, don't you and your mates get cold at all , I\nmean since all you have to wear is identical clothes? Isn't there a\nfashion industry or something?\n\n","answer":"We Mudokons tend to hang about in arid regions, and our\nloincloths, in addition to being sexy as all get-out, make for\ncomfortable living in such a climate.\n"},{"question":"Are Sligs really evil or are they just following orders?\n\n","answer":"Is Eddie Haskell evil? Sligs just gotta survive. They are\neasily influence by their surroundings. Evil breeds evil.\n"},{"question":"How come Sligs can't jump even when you chant one?\n\n","answer":"Given the shoddy manufacturing, it's amazing Sligs can even\nstay upright in their mechanical pants, let alone attempt to get\nathletic in them.\n"},{"question":"There's been something bothering me for a while now. Technically,\na Slig is about half critter, half machine right? What would be the\nscenario if Abe possessed the Slig, and Munch Possessed the pants?\n\n","answer":"Put yourself in Munch's shoes. Would you want to plug your\nmind into a Slig's pants?\n"},{"question":"How do Sligs turn into BigBro Sligs? Do they have this muscle\nbuilder fluid or what?\n\n","answer":"For a while they tried pumping iron and eating lots of\nhigh-protien foods and buying those Nordic-Track things that are\nadvertised at 3AM on cable. Then, inevitably, a Vykker came along with\nan invasive, destructive steroid that got the same results at a fraction\nof the cost. And the rest is history, albeit history that seems to be\nrepeated quite frequently.\n"},{"question":"My friend said that in Oddworld you can walk around doing nothing\nand slapping people continuously, is that true?????\n\n","answer":"Heck, you can do that in your world if I'm not mistaken ...\njust don't make any plans for the afternoon that you can't accomplish in\na body cast.\n"},{"question":"Yo Alf, why don't Interns have mouths, I mean what if something\ngoes wrong and they need to talk. It's weird!!!\n\n","answer":"They do have mouths. Or did, anyway. Let's just say that\nstitching technology has come a long way since they slapped those loose\nbindings on Abe's lips.\n"},{"question":"Hey, would you happen to know why Scrabs have calf muscles? I\nmean, their feet are just fixed spikes, so it seems like any contraction\nof the calf would fail to serve any purpose... Actuator muscles,\nmaybe?\n\n","answer":"You're talkin' to the wrong guy on this one. As far as I'm\nconcerned about Scrabs, they see you, they start moving. Whether they do\nthis via superfluous calf muscles or rocket engines, it's all the same\nto me, 'cause I am outta there.\n"},{"question":"Secondly, how can you reply to these E-mails if you are part of a\nrace with no idea of electronic devices?\n\n","answer":"What's E-mail?

Just coz we don’t wear shirts and ties, don’t mean we gots no\ndignity! There’s only two kindsa Sligs in this Oddworld: the kind that’s\ngot a proper job, and the kind that’s served in a bowl.

You can’t lease your\nunrivalled army to every factory franchise on the continent if the\nmajority of it is partially digested. There’s contracts and quotas to\nkeep!

What’s the point in that? Did I not\nexplain the thing about the unrivalled army delivered to every factory\nfranchise on the continent? A Slig Queen that don’t make Slig Workers is\nlike a RuptureFarms that don’t make Meech Munchies.
