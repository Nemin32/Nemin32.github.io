      <h3>INFORMATION ABOUT THE GAME:</h3>
      <p class = "centered">Most of the gameplay information in the EGX talk collected into an easily
      digestible list.</p>

      <div class="ul_container">
        <ul class="small">
          <li>
            <p>The game will still be a platformer, albeit it's levels will be "much more
            exciting than in the previous games".</p>

            <p class="bookpage"><a href = "https://magogonthemarch.com/transcripts/egx-2017-lorne-lanning-interview/">Lorne Lanning:</a></p>
            <p class="quoted">"Abe is really about followers, empathy, puzzles. So how do we
            do that but really turn the volume up to eleven on the genre? So I call it a
            platformer game and then push that dynamic too."</p>

            <p class="bookpage"><a href = "https://magogonthemarch.com/official-oddworld-discord-qa-2018/">Alex Carroll:</a></p>
            <p class="quoted">"I can say our levels are way more interesting."</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The game will feature a crafting system.</p>

            <p class="bookpage"><a href = "egx_images.html">Lorne Lanning:</a></p>
            <p class="quoted">"And those consumer products, he can start converting into
            weapons and he can have then start finding with collectibles crafting those
            weapons into more specialized things. So inventory system and crafting has
            become a key part of what Abe does to get all these Mudokons through the world
            safely, hopefully."</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The new thematic around brew is that if a Mudokon becomes addicted to it, then
            two days of withdrawal will result in their death by cardiac arrest.</p>

            <img src="imgs/ss_images/arrest.jpg">
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The brew is also very flammable, which can be potentially used in gameplay
            (area control?).</p>

            <p class="bookpage"><a href = "egx_images.html">Lorne Lanning:</a></p>
            <p class="quoted">"So let's just say brew, one of the side effects of brew is
            that it's highly flammable. And everyone's addicted to it!"</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Abe will be able to lead a huge number of Mudokons (up to 301) and OWI
            completely overhauled the GameSpeak to make this comfortable to use.</p>

            <p class="bookpage"><a href = "egx_images.html">Lorne Lanning:</a></p>
            <p class="quoted">"So this game begins with 301 freed Mudokons, that you're going
            to try and take with you through the journey, because they don't just
            disappear into the ether, they're gonna stay with you and at times in real
            time, in play you'll be managing the survival of this many guys on screen at
            one time."</p>
          </li>

          <p class="bookpage"><a href = "https://magogonthemarch.com/official-oddworld-discord-qa-2018/">Alex Carroll:</a></p>
          <p class="quoted">"We wouldn’t make it hard. If there are that many on screen at
          once (and in some cases there are) then Abe’s control over them is slightly
          different. We’ve refined Abe’s Gamespeak considerably."</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>It seems like the Mudokons will be capable of fighting back and the player can
            select how aggressive they will act.</p>

            <img src="imgs/ss_images/mood.jpg">
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Abe will have an HP bar, Ammo counter and he can also collect Moolah. And he
            will also be able to amass Chi, which will let him use powerful abilities.</p>

            <img src="imgs/ss_images/chi_hp.jpg">
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>To get the best ending no Slig must die. (Whether we can save them or we just
            have to leave them be is not known.)</p>

            <p class="bookpage"><a href = "egx_images.html">Lorne Lanning:</a></p>
            <p class="quoted">"And in this game you trying not to ideally kill the Sligs
            either. So a perfect play nobody dies.  That's hard as hell! You know, there's
            a lot of PTSD trauma that's going to take place before you achieve that goal,
            but that's our goal. In the ideal world Abe would have been able to traverse
            this very different, dangerous landscape and do that without killing anybody
            not even Sligs."</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>There is now a concrete Pyramid of Power that shows us just how powerful
            certain positions are.</p>

            <img src="imgs/brewing_pics/oddworld_pyramid.jpg">
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>RuptureFarms is confirmed to have burned down after it has been struck by
            lightning from the Mudokon Rainmaker.</p>

            <img src="imgs/brewing_pics/molluck_landscape.jpg">
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The original trio of Glukkons is now gone, replaced by brand ones.
            However, Molluck has returned and he looks pretty pissed off. Interestingly
            there is no Dripik. As I've <a href="facility_trivia">discussed before</a>, he didn't have
            much role in the Exoddus, so perhaps he is not part of Soulstorm's story.</p>

            <p class="bookpage"><a href = "egx_images.html">Lorne Lanning:</a></p>
            <p class="quoted">"We've renamed all the Glukkons that come with the other
            factories, so Aslik, Dripik and all of this. These are different guys now, as
            we were getting more away from what that original story was."</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The theme of Occultism seems to be returning in SS as evidenced by one Glukkon
            wearing the "Royal Society <strong>Alchemic</strong> Science" badge.</p>

            <img src="imgs/brewing_pics/brewmaster_badge.jpg">
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>ITEMS:</h3>
      <p>In the EGX talk Lanning showcased a few of the items found in Soulstorm. Here's
      a list of these screenshot out of the video. OWI has said that these items are
      early iterations of what we will be able to find in the final version, so take
      everything here with a grain of salt. The text in quotes are the official
      descriptions shown in the gameplay footage, the rest are my thoughts.</p>

      <div class="ul_container">
        <ul class="small">
          <li>
            <img class="original" src="imgs/ss_images/ss_brew.png">
            <em>Brew Bottle</em> - "Splashy, sticky, very tasty and highly flammable. Soulstorm Brew
            will help you get the party started and then help you burn down the venue when
            you've had enough."</p></li>

          <li>
            <img class="original" src="imgs/ss_images/cap.png">
            <em>Bottle Cap</em> - "We can't believe this ever got past the Food Standards people, but
            they put bottlecaps on Soulstorm Brew that make sparks when they hit against
            hard materials. Sparks plus flammable liquid equals fun."</p></li>

          <li>
            <img class="original" src="imgs/ss_images/extinguisher.png">
            <em>Fire Extinguisher</em> - "Look, we've all done it. Sometimes you just set fire to
            something you wanted to keep. Use this handy fire extinguisher to hastily
            correct your overzealous use of flames."</p></li>

          <li>
            <img class="original" src="imgs/ss_images/bottle.png">
            <em>Empty Bottle</em> - "An empty bottle? What was inside? Who's been having a party?
            Why weren't you invited? Never mind, at least these things can be recycled,
            right?"</p></li>

          <li>
            <img class="original" src="imgs/ss_images/gum.png">
            <em>Gum</em> - "The flavor lasts for a few a seconds, but the stickiness is eternal.
            Chew this up a bit and you can use it to stick one thing to another thing.
            Handy!"</p></li>

          <li>
            <img class="original" src="imgs/ss_images/lighter.png">
            <em>Lighter</em> - "It's like carrying a flint, some kindling at all times. Use it to
            start fires where there were previously no fires. Also handy to stick to other
            objects that might benefit from a quick and convenient fire source."</p></li>

          <li>
            <img class="original" src="imgs/ss_images/flamethrower.png">
            <em>Flamethrower</em> - "Well done. You've taken something that was made solely for
            putting out fires, tinkered around with it and made it into something that makes
            fire at a prodigious rate. Your momma would be proud."<br>

            Recipe: Fire extinguisher + Soulstorm Brew + Lighter</p></li>

          <li>
            <img class="original" src="imgs/ss_images/pop.png">
            <em>Purple bottle with a green decal and "PoP" written on it in white</em> - Reminds me a
            bit of the drinks you could get in Munch's Oddysee. Perhaps OWI is revisiting
            this concept.</p></li>

          <li>
            <img class="original" src="imgs/ss_images/pop_gum.png">
            <em>Purple bottle with a green decal and a purple band over it</em> - The color of this
            band is very similar to the gum, so perhaps this is the result of crafting the
            two together.</p></li>

          <li>
            <img class="original" src="imgs/ss_images/jawbreaker.png">
            <em>Jawbreaker-esque round object</em> - I have seriously no idea what this could be. It
            looks similar to a ball, but I don't have any idea why would you be able to
            carry around one. You can spot a few shapes on it, like a star in the
            bottom-left corner. Also, as the picture shows, you can carry 20 of these, so
            this object being big would make no sense.</p></li>

          <li>
            <img class="original" src="imgs/ss_images/water.png">
            <em>Blue drink in an SSB bottle</em> - This is obviously the bottle of SoulStorm Brew,
            however, the contents aren't the usual green, but instead a shade of blue. My
            only speculation is that it is perhaps medicine you can give your addicted
            Mudokons, so they don't die for another 48 hours, but without the side-effects
            or the flammability of the Brew.</p></li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3>CHARACTERS OF THE ARG:</h3>

      <p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/SPIRITOF1029">SPIRIT OF 1029</a></strong> - A Mudokon group of revolutionaries, created and named after
      Abe's deeds in RuptureFarms 1029. They like to liken themselves to a storm.
      Their main way of communication are short Tweets denouncing the Magog Cartel and
      short catchphrases like "We will rise!". Also their logo is based on the
      front-side view of RuptureFarms erupting in flames.</p>

      <p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/MagogCartel">THE MAGOG CARTEL</a></strong> - Diabolical as always, they both tell you that everything is
      fine and also that if anything is not fine, it's not their fault. They like to
      alternate between propaganda fliers and sardonic remarks towards employees,
      products and workplace-safety. Their logo is similar to the old octopus-like
      black and white emblem, however, it has become sleeker and taller.</p>

      <p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/edmudokon">ED</a></strong> - This scaredy schmuck is actually a really important part of the resistance.
      By leaking information he brings the horrors the Magog to the public's
      attention. He personally never says too much and that little is usually filled
      with him being afraid.</p>

      <p><strong>ALF</strong> - This Mud is not someone you need to be introduced to. He's smooth as
      always, however, the recent turn of events and Ed's pleas have revealed this
      usually cheerful guy's caring and anxious side.</p>

      <p><strong>ASSET98</strong> - Another member of the SO1029. While his input provided to be very
      important in solving the mysteries of the ARG, his career was cut short when the
      Cartel caught and executed him because of the community's mishap.</p>

      <p><strong>ASSET99</strong> - Asset 98's successor, he is just as secretive as 98 was. He also
      provided vital information towards the solutions of multiple puzzles.</p>
