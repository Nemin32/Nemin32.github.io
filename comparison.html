    <h1>Graphically comparing the recent Abe games</h1>

    <p>Since Soulstorm features a lot of things Exoddus and New 'n' Tasty also feature,
    I figured it would be interesting to see the similarities and differences. All
    pictures come from HD videos and I've tried to take the pictures from similar
    distances.</p>

    <h2>Characters</h2>

    <div class="compare_div">
      <img src="imgs/comparison/abe_ae.jpg">
      <img src="imgs/comparison/abe_nnt.jpg">
      <img src="imgs/comparison/abe_ss.jpg">
    </div>

    <p>Let's start with Abe since he received some of the largest changes. He's no
    longer blue as in Exoddus, however, he's also not purple, like in NnT, instead
    he now has a slightly sickly grayish-purplish skin tone, along with more
    detailed anatomy and actual feathers instead of a ponytail.</p>

    <div class="compare_div">
    <img src="imgs/comparison/chant_ae.jpg">
    <img src="imgs/comparison/chant_nnt.jpg">
    <img src="imgs/comparison/chant_ss.jpg">
    </div>

    <p>The color of chanting changed the exact opposite way: Similarly to Abe it
    started out as blue, then it became grayish-purplish in NnT and finally turned
    into purple in Soulstorm.</p>

    <div class="compare_div">
      <img src="imgs/comparison/workers_ae.jpg">
      <img src="imgs/comparison/workers_nnt.jpg">
      <img src="imgs/comparison/workers_ss.jpg">
    </div>

    <p>Instead of their color, the working Mudokons of Soulstorm are differentiated by
    their uniforms and working hats, that they throw away, when Abe calls to them.
    Their skin color is now only slightly darker than Abe's.</p>

    <div class="compare_div">
      <img src="imgs/comparison/slig_ae.jpg">
      <img src="imgs/comparison/slig_nnt.jpg">
      <img src="imgs/comparison/slig_ss.jpg">
    </div>

    <p>Next up Sligs: The old HUD Visor (the single red slit on the mask) seems to be
    gone for good and all Sligs instead wear the Pilot Googles. Also Soulstorm's
    Sligs have much more detailed pants and masks. Also, their skin color has went
    from greenish in AE, to yellow-green in NnT and definitely yellow in
    Soulstorm.</p>

    <h2>Objects</h2>

    <div class="compare_div">
      <img src="imgs/comparison/bp_ae.jpg">
      <img src="imgs/comparison/bp_nnt.jpg">
      <img src="imgs/comparison/bp_ss.jpg">
    </div>

    <p>While NnT and Exoddus feature similar Bird Portals, aside from NnT's yellowish
    ring, the one in Soulstorm looks quite different. It is much smaller and rounder
    and it also has some purple lights coming out of it's centre.</p>

    <div class="compare_div">
      <img src="imgs/comparison/open_ae.jpg">
      <img src="imgs/comparison/open_nnt.jpg">
      <img src="imgs/comparison/open_ss.jpg">
    </div>

    <p>However, there doesn't seem to be any major changes between NnT's version of the
    open portal and Soulstorm's (other than slightly different light emanating from
    it).</p>

    <div class="compare_div">
      <img src="imgs/comparison/orb_ae.jpg">
      <img src="imgs/comparison/orb_nnt.jpg">
      <img src="imgs/comparison/orb_ss.jpg">
    </div>

    <p>Similarly to above, the Security Orbs also didn't change much between NnT and
    Soulstorm, except the Orbs of Soulstorm occasionally emit sparks of red
    electricity.</p>

    <div class="compare_div">
      <img src="imgs/comparison/brew_ae.jpg">
      <img src="imgs/comparison/brew_ss.jpg">
    </div>

    <p>Since vending machines will be a prevalent mechanic in Soulstorm, the Brew
    dispensers themselves have received a similar design, making them quite
    different compared to Exoddus' dispensers. However, the signature laughing
    Glukkon remained.</p>

    <img src="imgs/comparison/screen_ae.jpg">

    <div class="compare_div">
      <img src="imgs/comparison/screen_nnt.jpg">
      <img src="imgs/comparison/screen_ss.jpg">
    </div>

    <p>Other than the obvious graphical changes, Soulstorm's status indicator screens
    also show the status of Sligs.</p>

    <div class="compare_div">
      <img src="imgs/comparison/train_ae.jpg">
      <img src="imgs/comparison/train_ss.jpg">
    </div>

    <p>The two trains are quite similar, however, Soulstorm's has received a few
    minor changes on the front and on the little tower on the top of the train. Also
    of course Soulstorm's train is a bit more detailed.</p>
