      <h1>The GDC Trailer</h1>

      <p>On March 18 Lorne Lanning and Bennie Terry presented us with a short, five
        minute showcase of one of Soulstorm's cutscenes and also a demonstration of a
        model.</p>

      <p>As expected it has generated a lot of reactions, I'd like to share mine
        here. Similarly to all my other essays, this writeup is my own personal opinion,
        largely based on feelings.</p>

      <h2>THE GOOD</h2>

      <img src="imgs/GDC/sligs.png">
      <p class="subtitle">Flying Sligs</p>

      <p>Most of the teaser looks quite nice. The train looks well detailed and while it
        resembles the old train used in Exoddus, it became a bit more refined. It is an
        example of positive deviation from the originals, along with the the new Slig
        design, which I am liking a lot. While it is a bit questionable whether they could
        carry gatling-guns with such little propellers, I'm willing to suspend my
        disbelief in this case. Their mouth-tentacles being smeared all over their faces
        because of the wind was a nice touch for both realism and a slight touch of
        humor. I am also glad that OWI kept the look of SoulStorm Brew providing at
        least a small amount of connection to the old Quintology. It also being used for
        fuel is an excellent idea and it makes a lot of sense considering they are
        flammable.</p>
      
      <img src="imgs/GDC/shaman.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle">The Shaman</p>

      <p>The Shaman model was a really pleasant surprise. It radiates the old
        Oddworld-feel, which made me quite happy. While I prefer the Big Face as
        Oddworld's shaman figure, the garment and mask of the new figure was
        astonishing. It resembles indian ceremonial clothing, but it is original enough
        to not feel like a copy at all.</p>

      <h2>THE BAD</h2>

      <p>Since the news are full of this info, it won't be a surprise to anyone, but
        along with the showcase of the cutscene, the game has been delayed yet another
        year. This is the third time this has happened and yet again it went down
        without any kind of fanfare.</p>
      
      <img src="imgs/GDC/specks.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle">The specks on the camera.</p>

      <p>As for the video itself, it sadly continues the trend of being overly
        cinematic. For example, the "camera" became an actualy camera instead of some
        ethereal, non-existent thing through which we see the events. What I mean by
        this is that through the entire clip the picture has dust specks on it. I firmly
        believe that this is a bad direction to take the game's art direction
        towards. Oddworld never needed to be like a movie to provide the same amount of
        entertainment movies do. To add insult to injury, these dust specks are totally
        static. If they dinamically flew on and flew off the camera, it'd feel much less
        fake.</p>

      <p>While my untrained eyes didn't spot anything else, I'd like to link Phoetux's
        comment on OWF about the video, where he goes way more in-depth about the
        possible flaws of the animation:</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.oddworldforums.net/showpost.php?p=637322&postcount=18">http://www.oddworldforums.net/showpost.php?p=637322&postcount=18</a></p>

      <h2>THE UGLY</h2>
      
      <img src="imgs/GDC/alf.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle">Alf looking rather iffy.</p>

      <p>The Mudokons.</p>

      <p>Alf is bearable, albeit some of his facial expressions look quite unnatural (and
        not in the Oddworldish sense). My only concern with him is that at the end of
        the video when he walks through the inside of the train, his animations feel
        way too weightless and floaty.</p>
      
      <img src="imgs/GDC/toby.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle">"FASTEEER!"</p>

      <p>But Toby... He is different. There are truly very few
        characters in Oddworld I dislike and almost all of them are part
        of Stranger's Wrath, but after this video this group has sadly
        grew with one more member.</p>

      <p>Not only is he terribly awkward in a bad way, his animation and facial
        expressions defy logic. People have brought up that Oddworld used goofy
        characters and animations before and it's true, however, they were always much
        more moderate even when they were played for laughs.</p>

      <img src="imgs/GDC/toby.gif">
      <p class="subtitle">Step dance!</p>

      <p>Compare the over the top nature of the gif above with the scene
        where a blind Mudokon is unwittingly killed by Abe in Exoddus. It
        was a joke, yet it was also quite dark and it also provided info
        for the player (Blind Mudokons will fall into their death - be on watch).</p>

      <h2>THE MEH</h2>

      <p>Alf saying "Holy shit!" did raise my eyebrow, but ultimately I don't
        really have strong feelings about Oddworld characters using stronger
        swears. Stranger's Wrath already has plenty of swears in it and
        while it didn't take away from the experience, it didn't really
        add anything either.</p>
      
      <img src="imgs/GDC/slig_shot.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle">Oww.</p>

      <p>Toby gets his hand shot. This belongs in this category as unless you
        watch the video on 0.25x speed, it is pretty much unnoticeable.</p>

      <p>Abe not being in the video. I'll explain shortly below why I think
        he's not here.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion and Theory</h2>

      <p>So the watchful viewer can notice quite a few things that help us
        roughly place this cutscene in the timeline of the game. In my
        reading, this is at least a mid-game cutscene, but even more likely
        it's a late-game one. My reasoning is the following:</p>

      <br>

      <div class="ul_container">
        <ul class="small">
	        <li> Toby and Alf are riding towards SoulStorm Brewery, the
	          central location of the entire story.</li>
	        <li> The aforementioned characters being 'comfortable' in each
	          others' presence. If this was an early-game cutscene, they'd be
	          less "casual" talking with eachother.</li>
	        <li> Alf has surpassed his Brew addiction and is throwing the
	          drink without second thoughts into the fire.</li>
	        <li> Abe is nowhere to be seen. I believe he's most likely captive
	          in SoulStorm Brewery and that's why the duo is riding the train
	          there.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <br>

      <p class="centered">Ultimately despite my bashing of the video, it
        was still a postiive experience, just not to the extent I believe
        Oddworld Inhabitants is capable of.</p>
